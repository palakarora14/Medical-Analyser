0,Fungal infection,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Keeping the skin clean and dry, as well as maintaining good hygiene, will help larger topical mycoses. Because fungal infections are contagious, it is important to wash after touching other people or animals. Sports clothing should also be washed after use.[citation needed]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Topical and systemic antifungal drugs are used to treat mycoses.

1,Allergy,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div>Further information: Allergy prevention in children</div><p>Dietary avoidance is not effective as a preventative measure for allergies.[77][91][92] Early exposure to potential allergens may actually be protective.[6] Fish oil supplementation during pregnancy and exclusive breast feeding is associated with a lower risk.[93] Probiotic supplements taken during pregnancy or infancy may help to prevent atopic dermatitis.[94][95]
</p><p>Some foods during pregnancy have been linked to allergies in the child. Vegetable oil, nuts and fast food may increase the risk while fruits, vegetables and fish may decrease it.[96] Another review found no effect of eating fish during pregnancy on allergy risk.[97]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Management of allergies typically involves avoiding what triggers the allergy and medications to improve the symptoms.[7] Allergen immunotherapy may be useful for some types of allergies.[7]
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>Several medications may be used to block the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes. These include antihistamines, glucocorticoids, epinephrine (adrenaline), mast cell stabilizers, and antileukotriene agents are common treatments of allergic diseases.[98] Anti-cholinergics, decongestants, and other compounds thought to impair eosinophil chemotaxis, are also commonly used. Although rare, the severity of anaphylaxis often requires epinephrine injection, and where medical care is unavailable, a device known as an epinephrine autoinjector may be used.[26]
</p><h3>Immunotherapy[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Allergen immunotherapy</div><div> Anti-allergy immunotherapy</div><p>Allergen immunotherapy is useful for environmental allergies, allergies to insect bites, and asthma.[7][99] Its benefit for food allergies is unclear and thus not recommended.[7] Immunotherapy involves exposing people to larger and larger amounts of allergen in an effort to change the immune system's response.[7]
</p><p>Meta-analyses have found that injections of allergens under the skin is effective in the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children[100][101] and in asthma.[99] The benefits may last for years after treatment is stopped.[102] It is generally safe and effective for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, allergic forms of asthma, and stinging insects.[103]
</p><p>The evidence also supports the use of sublingual immunotherapy for rhinitis and asthma but it is less strong.[102] For seasonal allergies the benefit is small.[104] In this form the allergen is given under the tongue and people often prefer it to injections.[102] Immunotherapy is not recommended as a stand-alone treatment for asthma.[102]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><p>An experimental treatment, enzyme potentiated desensitization (EPD), has been tried for decades but is not generally accepted as effective.[105] EPD uses dilutions of allergen and an enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, to which T-regulatory lymphocytes are supposed to respond by favoring desensitization, or down-regulation, rather than sensitization. EPD has also been tried for the treatment of autoimmune diseases but evidence does not show effectiveness.[105]
</p><p>A review found no effectiveness of homeopathic treatments and no difference compared with placebo. The authors concluded that, based on rigorous clinical trials of all types of homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments, there is no convincing evidence that supports the use of homeopathic treatments.[106]
</p><p>According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, U.S, the evidence is relatively strong that saline nasal irrigation and butterbur are effective, when compared to other alternative medicine treatments, for which the scientific evidence is weak, negative, or nonexistent, such as honey, acupuncture, omega 3's, probiotics, astragalus, capsaicin, grape seed extract, Pycnogenol, quercetin, spirulina, stinging nettle, tinospora or guduchi.
[107][108]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Low-allergen foods are being developed, as are improvements in skin prick test predictions; evaluation of the atopy patch test; in wasp sting outcomes predictions and a rapidly disintegrating epinephrine tablet, and anti-IL-5 for eosinophilic diseases.[143]
</p><p>Aerobiology is the study of the biological particles passively dispersed through the air. One aim is the prevention of allergies due to pollen.[144][145]
</p>"
2,GERD,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatments for GERD may include food choices, lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly surgery. Initial treatment is frequently with a proton-pump inhibitor such as omeprazole.[26] In some cases, a person with GERD symptoms can manage them by taking over-the-counter drugs.[32] This is often safer and less expensive than taking prescription drugs.[32] Some guidelines recommend trying to treat symptoms with an H2 antagonist before using a proton-pump inhibitor because of cost and safety concerns.[32]
</p><h3>Lifestyle changes[edit]</h3><p>Certain foods may promote GERD, but most dietary interventions have little effect.[33] Some evidence suggests that reduced sugar intake and increased fiber intake can help.[34] Avoidance of specific foods and eating before lying down are recommended for those having GERD symptoms.[27] Foods that may precipitate GERD include coffee, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods, acidic foods, and spicy foods.[27]
</p><p>Weight loss may be effective in reducing the severity and frequency of symptoms.[35] Elevating the head of the entire bed with blocks, or using a wedge pillow that elevates the individual's shoulders and head, may inhibit GERD when lying down.[36] Although moderate exercise may improve symptoms in people with GERD, vigorous exercise may worsen them.[33]
</p><p>Abstinence from smoking or alcohol does not appear to significantly relieve symptoms.[35]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Drugs for acid-related disorders</div><p>The primary medications used for GERD are proton-pump inhibitors, H2 receptor blockers and antacids with or without alginic acid.[8] The use of acid suppression therapy is a common response to GERD symptoms and many people get more of this kind of treatment than their case merits.[37] The overuse of acid suppression is a problem because of the side effects and costs.[37]
</p><h4>Proton-pump inhibitors[edit]</h4><p>Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole, are the most effective, followed by H2 receptor blockers, such as ranitidine.[27] If a once daily PPI is only partially effective they may be used twice a day.[27] They should be taken one half to one hour before a meal.[26] There is no significant difference between PPIs.[26] When these medications are used long term, the lowest effective dose should be taken.[27] They may also be taken only when symptoms occur in those with frequent problems.[26] H2 receptor blockers lead to roughly a 40% improvement.[38]
</p><h4>Antacids[edit]</h4><p>The evidence for antacids is weaker with a benefit of about 10% (NNT=13) while a combination of an antacid and alginic acid (such as Gaviscon) may improve symptoms 60% (NNT=4).[38] Metoclopramide (a prokinetic) is not recommended either alone or in combination with other treatments due to concerns around adverse effects.[8][27] The benefit of the prokinetic mosapride is modest.[8]
</p><h4>Other agents[edit]</h4><p>Sucralfate has a similar effectiveness to H2 receptor blockers; however, sucralfate needs to be taken multiple times a day, thus limiting its use.[8] Baclofen, an agonist of the GABAB receptor, while effective, has similar issues of needing frequent dosing in addition to greater adverse effects compared to other medications.[8]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>The standard surgical treatment for severe GERD is the Nissen fundoplication. In this procedure, the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent acid reflux and to repair a hiatal hernia.[39] It is recommended only for those who do not improve with PPIs.[26] Quality of life is improved in the short term compared to medical therapy, but there is uncertainty in the benefits over surgery versus long-term medical management with proton pump inhibitors.[40] When comparing different fundoplication techniques, partial posterior fundoplication surgery is more effective than partial anterior fundoplication surgery,[41] and partial fundoplication has better outcomes than total fundoplication.[42]
</p><p>Esophagogastric dissociation is an alternative procedure that is sometimes used to treat neurologically impaired children with GERD.[43][44] Preliminary studies have shown it may have a lower failure rate[45] and a lower incidence of recurrent reflux.[44]
</p><p>In 2012 the FDA approved a device called the LINX, which consists of a series of metal beads with magnetic cores that are placed surgically around the lower esophageal sphincter, for those with severe symptoms that do not respond to other treatments. Improvement of GERD symptoms is similar to those of the Nissen fundoplication, although there is no data regarding long-term effects. Compared to Nissen fundoplication procedures, the procedure has shown a reduction in complications such as gas bloat syndrome that commonly occur.[46] Adverse responses include difficulty swallowing, chest pain, vomiting, and nausea. Contraindications that would advise against use of the device are patients who are or may be allergic to titanium, stainless steel, nickel, or ferrous iron materials. A warning advises that the device should not be used by patients who could be exposed to, or undergo, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of serious injury to the patient and damage to the device.[47]
</p><p>In those with symptoms that do not improve with PPIs surgery known as transoral incisionless fundoplication may help.[48] Benefits may last for up to six years.[49]
</p><h3>Special populations[edit]</h3><h4>Pregnancy[edit]</h4><p>In pregnancy, dietary modifications and lifestyle changes may be attempted, but often have little effect. Calcium-based antacids are recommended if these changes are not effective. Aluminum- and magnesium-based antacids are also safe, as is ranitidine[50] and PPIs.[26]
</p><h4>Babies[edit]</h4><p>Babies may see relief with smaller, more frequent feedings, more frequent burping during feedings, holding baby in upright position 30 minutes after feedings, keep baby's head elevated while laying on the back, remove milk and soy from mothers diet or feed milk protein free formula.[51]  They may also be treated with medicines such as ranitidine or proton pump inhibitors.[52] Proton pump inhibitors however have not been found to be effective in this population and there is a lack of evidence for safety.[53]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>A number of endoscopic devices have been tested to treat chronic heartburn.
</p><ul>Endocinch, puts stitches in the lower esophogeal sphincter (LES) to create small pleats to help strengthen the muscle. However, long-term results were disappointing, and the device is no longer sold by Bard.[55]
Stretta procedure, uses electrodes to apply radio-frequency energy to the LES. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis in response to the systematic review (no meta-analysis) conducted by SAGES did not support the claims that Stretta was an effective treatment for GERD.[56] A 2012 systematic review found that it improves GERD symptoms.[57]
NDO Surgical Plicator creates a plication, or fold, of tissue near the gastroesophageal junction, and fixates the plication with a suture-based implant. The company ceased operations in mid-2008, and the device is no longer on the market.
Transoral incisionless fundoplication, which uses a device called Esophyx, may be effective.[58]</ul>"
3,Chronic cholestasis,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Extrahepatic cholestasis can usually be treated by surgery.
Pruritis in cholestatic jaundice is treated by antihistamines, ursodeoxycholic acid, and phenobarbital.
Nalfurafine hydrochloride can also treat pruritus caused by chronic liver disease and was recently approved in Japan for this purpose.[citation needed]
</p>"
4,Drug Reaction,"Treatment

Interventions for a drug allergy can be divided into two general strategies:

    Treatment for present allergy symptoms
    Treatment that may enable you to take an allergy-causing drug if it's medically necessary

Treating current symptoms

The following interventions may be used to treat an allergic reaction to a drug:

    Withdrawal of the drug. If your doctor determines that you have a drug allergy — or likely allergy — discontinuing the drug is the first step in treatment. In many cases, this may be the only intervention necessary.
    Antihistamines. Your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine or recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) that can block immune system chemicals activated during an allergic reaction.
    Corticosteroids. Either oral or injected corticosteroids may be used to treat inflammation associated with more-serious reactions.
    Treatment of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires an immediate epinephrine injection as well as hospital care to maintain blood pressure and support breathing.

Taking allergy-causing drugs

If you have a confirmed drug allergy, your doctor would not prescribe the drug unless it is necessary. In some cases — if the diagnosis of drug allergy is uncertain or there's no alternative treatment — your doctor may use one of two strategies to use the suspect drug.

With either strategy, your doctor provides careful supervision, and supportive care services are available to treat an adverse reaction. These interventions are generally avoided if drugs have caused severe, life-threatening reactions in the past.
Graded challenge

If the diagnosis of a drug allergy is uncertain and your doctor judges that an allergy is unlikely, he or she may recommend a graded drug challenge. With this procedure, you receive two to five doses of the drug, starting with a small dose and increasing to the desired dose.

If you reach the therapeutic dose with no reaction, then your doctor will conclude that you aren't allergic to the drug. You will be able to take the drug as prescribed.
Drug desensitization

If it's necessary for you to take a drug that has caused an allergic reaction, your doctor may recommend a treatment called drug desensitization. With this treatment, you receive a very small dose and then progressively larger doses every 15 to 30 minutes over several hours or days. If you can reach the desired dosage with no reaction, then you can continue the treatment."
5,Peptic ulcer diseae,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Prevention of peptic ulcer disease for those who are taking NSAIDs (with low cardiovascular risk) can be achieved by adding proton pump inhibitor (PPI), H2 antagonist, or misoprostol.[14] NSAIDs of the COX-2 inhibitors type may reduce the rate of ulcers when compared to non-selective NSAIDs.[14] PPI is the most popular agent in peptic ulcer prevention.[14] However, there is no evidence that H2 antagonist can prevent stomach bleeding for those taking NSAIDs.[14] Although misoprostol is effective in preventing peptic ulcer, its properties of promoting abortion and causing gastrointestinal distress limits its use.[14] For those with high cardiovascular risk, naproxen with PPI can be a useful choice.[14] Otherwise, low dose aspirin, celecoxib, and PPI can also be used.[14]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div> Peptic ulcer treatment: pharmacology of drugs</div><h3>Eradication therapy[edit]</h3><p>Once the diagnosis of H. pylori is confirmed, the first line treatment would be a triple regimen where pantoprazole and clarithromycin can be combined with either amoxicillin or metronidazole. This treatment regimen can be given for 7 until 14 days. However, its effectiveness of eradicating H. pylori has been reducing from 90% to 70%. However, the rate of eradication can be increased by doubling the dosage of pantoprazole or increase the duration of treatment to 14 days. Quadruple therapy (pantoprazole + clarithromycin + amoxicillin + metronidazole) can also be used. The quadruple therapy can achieve an eradication rate of 90%. If the clarithromycin resistance rate is higher than 15% in an area, the usage of clarithromycin should be abandoned. Instead bismuth containing quadruple therapy can be used (pantoprazole + bismuth citrate + tetracycline + metronidazole) for 14 days. The bismuth therapy can also achieve an eradication rate of 90% and can be used as second line therapy when the first line triple regimen therapy failed.[14]
</p><p>After H. pylori is eradicated, there is low risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding when NSAIDs are resumed.[14]
</p><h3>NSAIDs induced ulcers[edit]</h3><p>NSAIDs associated ulcers heal in 6 to 8 weeks provided the NSAIDs are withdrawn with the introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPI).[14]
</p><h3>Bleeding[edit]</h3><p>For those with bleeding peptic ulcers, fluid replacement with crystalloids should be given to maintain volume in the blood vessels. Hameoglobin should be maintained at greater than 70 g/dL through restrictive blood transfusion because it has been associated with reduced rate of death. Glasgow-Blatchford score is useful in determining whether a patient should be treated inside hospital or as outpatient. Intravenous PPI can give faster stomach bleeding suppression compared to oral ones. A neutral stomach pH is required to keep platelet in place and to prevent clot lysis. Tranexamic acid and antifibrinolytic agents are not useful in peptic ulcer disease.[14]
</p><p>Early endoscopic therapy can help to stop bleeding by using cautery, endoclip or epinephrine injection. Treatment is indicated if there is active bleeding in the stomach, visible vessel, or an adherent clot. Endoscopy is also helpful in identifying patients suitable for hospital discharge. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin and metoclopramide can be given before endoscopy to improve endoscopic view. Either high or low dose PPI are equally effective in reducing bleeding after endoscopy. High dose intravenous PPI is defined as bolus dose of 80 mg followed by infusion of 8 mg per hour for 72 hours. In other words, it is the continuous infusion of PPI of greater than 192 mg per day. Intravenous PPI can be changed to oral once there is no high risk of rebleeding from peptic ulcer.[14]
</p><p>For those with hypovolemic shock and ulcer size of greater than 2 cm, there is a high chance that the endoscopic treatment would fail. Therefore, surgery and angiographic embolism are reserved for these complicated cases. However, there is a higher rate of complication for those who underwent surgery to patch the stomach bleeding site when compared to repeated endoscopy. Angiographic embolisation has higher rebleeding rate but has similar rate of death when compared to surgery.[14]
</p><h3>Anticoagulants[edit]</h3><p>According to expert opinion, those who are already on anticoagulants, international normalized ratio (INR) should be kept at 1.5. For aspirin users who required endoscopic treatment for bleeding peptic ulcer, there is two times increased risk of rebleeding but with 10 times reduced risk of death at 8 weeks post resumption of aspirin. For those who were on double antiplatelet agents for indwelling stent in blood vessels, both antiplatelet agents should not be stopped because there is high risk of stent thrombosis. For those which was under warfarin treatment, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant factor VIIa can be given to reverse the effect of warfarin. High dose of vitamin K should be avoided to reduce the time for rewarfarinisation once the stomach bleeding has stopped. Prothrombin complex concentrates is preferred for severe bleeding. Recombinant factor VIIa is reserved for life-threatening bleeding because of its high risk of thromboembolism.[14] Direct oral anticoagulants  (DOAC) is recommended instead of warfarin as they are more effective in preventing thromboembolism. In case of bleeding caused by DOAC, activated charcoal within 4 hours is the antidote of choice. Hamodialysis maybe given for bleeding caused by dabigatran. Anticoagulants should be resumed as soon as possible for those with high cardiovascular risk because although risk of rebleeding increases, the overall mortality decreases with resumption of anticoagulants.[14]
</p>"
6,AIDS,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div>Main article: Prevention of HIV/AIDS</div><div> AIDS Clinic, McLeod Ganj, Himachal Pradesh, India, 2010</div><h3>Sexual contact</h3><p>Consistent condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately 80% over the long term.[112] When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year.[113] There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection.[114] Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women.[115] By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.[116]
</p><p>Circumcision in Sub-Saharan Africa ""reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months"".[117] Due to these studies, both the World Health Organization and UNAIDS recommended male circumcision in 2007 as a method of preventing female-to-male HIV transmission in areas with high rates of HIV.[118] However, whether it protects against male-to-female transmission is disputed,[119][120] and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined.[121][122][123] The International Antiviral Society, however, does recommend it for all sexually active heterosexual males and that it be discussed as an option with men who have sex with men.[124] Some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may cause more sexual risk-taking behavior, thus negating its preventive effects.[125]
</p><p>Programs encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent HIV risk.[126] Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor.[127] Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior.[128][129] A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV.[130] Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive.[131] It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.[61]
</p><h3>Pre-exposure</h3><p>Antiretroviral treatment among people with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP).[132] TASP is associated with a 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk.[132][133] Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including men who have sex with men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.[115] It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100 person years.[134] The USPSTF, ini a 2018 draft, recommended PrEP in those who are at high risk.[135]
</p><p>Universal precautions within the health care environment are believed to be effective in decreasing the risk of HIV.[136] Intravenous drug use is an important risk factor and harm reduction strategies such as needle-exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk.[137][138]
</p><h3>Post-exposure</h3><p>A course of antiretrovirals administered within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions is referred to as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).[139] The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury.[139] As of 2013[update], the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.[140]
</p><p>PEP treatment is recommended after a sexual assault when the perpetrator is known to be HIV positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown.[141] The duration of treatment is usually four weeks[142] and is frequently associated with adverse effects—where zidovudine is used, about 70% of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).[49]
</p><h3>Mother-to-child</h3><div>Main article: HIV and pregnancy</div><p>Programs to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%.[78][137] This primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding.[78][143] If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case.[144] If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission.[145] In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.[146]
</p><h3>Vaccination</h3><div>Main article: HIV vaccine</div><p>Currently, there is no licensed vaccine for HIV or AIDS.[6] The most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009 and found a partial reduction in the risk of transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine.[147] Further trials of the RV 144 vaccine are ongoing.[148][149]
</p><h2>Treatment</h2><div>Main article: Management of HIV/AIDS</div><p>There is currently no cure or effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) which slows progression of the disease.[150] As of 2010[update] more than 6.6 million people were taking them in low and middle income countries.[151] Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections.
</p><h3>Antiviral therapy</h3><div> Stribild – a common once-daily ART regime consisting of elvitegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir and the booster cobicistat</div><p>Current HAART options are combinations (or ""cocktails"") consisting of at least three medications belonging to at least two types, or ""classes,"" of antiretroviral agents.[152] Initially treatment is typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).[153] Typical NRTIs include: zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC).[153] Combinations of agents which include protease inhibitors (PI) are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness.[152]
</p><p>The World Health Organization and United States recommends antiretrovirals in people of all ages including pregnant women as soon as the diagnosis is made regardless of CD4 count.[14][124][154] Once treatment is begun it is recommended that it is continued without breaks or ""holidays"".[29] Many people are diagnosed only after treatment ideally should have begun.[29] The desired outcome of treatment is a long term plasma HIV-RNA count below 50 copies/mL.[29] Levels to determine if treatment is effective are initially recommended after four weeks and once levels fall below 50 copies/mL checks every three to six months are typically adequate.[29] Inadequate control is deemed to be greater than 400 copies/mL.[29] Based on these criteria treatment is effective in more than 95% of people during the first year.[29]
</p><p>Benefits of treatment include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death.[155] In the developing world treatment also improves physical and mental health.[156] With treatment there is a 70% reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis.[152] Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mother-to-child transmission.[152][157] The effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance.[29] Reasons for non-adherence include poor access to medical care,[158] inadequate social supports, mental illness and drug abuse.[159] The complexity of treatment regimens (due to pill numbers and dosing frequency) and adverse effects may  reduce adherence.[160] Even though cost is an important issue with some medications,[161] 47% of those who needed them were taking them in low and middle income countries as of 2010[update][151] and the rate of adherence is similar in low-income and high-income countries.[162]
</p><p>Specific adverse events are related to the antiretroviral agent taken.[163] Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors.[25] Other common symptoms include diarrhea,[163][164] and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[165] Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects.[29] Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.[29]
</p><p>Treatment recommendations for children are somewhat different from those for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than 5 years of age; children above 5 are treated like adults.[166] The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100,000 copies/mL between one year and five years of age.[167]
</p><h3>Opportunistic infections</h3><p>Measures to prevent opportunistic infections are effective in many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals reduces the risk of developing additional opportunistic infections.[163] Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed.[168] Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection.[169] Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings.[170] It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200 cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP.[171] People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC.[172] Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997.[173] Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.[174][175]
</p><h3>Diet</h3><div>Main article: Nutrition and HIV/AIDS</div><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in HIV/AIDS.[176] A generally healthy diet is promoted. Dietary intake of micronutrients at RDA levels by HIV-infected adults is recommended by the WHO; higher intake of vitamin A, zinc, and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV positive adults, and is not recommended unless there is documented deficiency.[176][177][178][179] Dietary supplementation for people who are infected with HIV and who have inadequate nutrition or dietary deficiencies may strengthen their immune systems or help them recover from infections, however evidence indicating an overall benefit in morbidity or reduction in mortality is not consistent.[180]
</p><p>Evidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit.[181]  For pregnant and lactating women with HIV, multivitamin supplement improves outcomes for both mothers and children.[182]  If the pregnant or lactating mother has been advised to take anti-retroviral medication to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, multivitamin supplements should not replace these treatments.[182] There is some evidence that vitamin A supplementation in children with an HIV infection reduces mortality and improves growth.[183]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>In the US, approximately 60% of people with HIV use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine,[184] even though the effectiveness of most of these therapies has not been established.[185]  There is not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines.[186] There is insufficient evidence to recommend or support the use of medical cannabis to try to increase appetite or weight gain.[187]
</p><h2>Research</h2><div>Main article: HIV/AIDS research</div><p>HIV/AIDS research includes all medical research which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS along with fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.
</p><p>Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and circumcision and HIV. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, by tracking standard HIV indicators.[295] Use of common indicators is an increasing focus of development organizations and researchers.[296][297]

7,Diabetes ,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div>See also: Prevention of diabetes mellitus type 2</div><p>There is no known preventive measure for type 1 diabetes.[2] Type 2 diabetes—which accounts for 85–90% of all cases worldwide—can often be prevented or delayed by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity, and eating a healthy diet.[2] Higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%.[71] Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish.[72] Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent diabetes.[72] Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well.[73]
</p><p>The relationship between type 2 diabetes and the main modifiable risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. There is growing evidence that the underlying determinants of diabetes are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change: globalization, urbanization, population aging, and the general health policy environment.[74]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Diabetes management</div><div>Play media Overview of the management of diabetes</div><p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease, for which there is no known cure except in very specific situations.[75] Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal, without causing low blood sugar. This can usually be accomplished with a healthy diet, exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type 1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type 2 diabetes).
</p><p>Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.[76][77] The goal of treatment is an HbA1C level of 6.5%, but should not be lower than that, and may be set higher.[78] Attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the negative effects of diabetes. These include smoking, elevated cholesterol levels, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of regular exercise.[78] Specialized footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of ulceration, or re-ulceration, in at-risk diabetic feet. Evidence for the efficacy of this remains equivocal, however.[79]
</p><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><div>See also: Diabetic diet</div><p>People with diabetes can benefit from education about the disease and treatment, good nutrition to achieve a normal body weight, and exercise, with the goal of keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels within acceptable bounds. In addition, given the associated higher risks of cardiovascular disease, lifestyle modifications are recommended to control blood pressure.[80][81]
</p><p>No single dietary pattern is best for all people with diabetes. For overweight people with type 2 diabetes, any diet that achieves weight loss is effective.[82][83]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><h4>Glucose control[edit]</h4><div>See also: Anti-diabetic medication</div><p>Medications used to treat diabetes do so by lowering blood sugar levels. There is broad consensus that when people with diabetes maintain tight glucose control (also called ""tight glycemic control"") – keeping the glucose levels in their blood within normal ranges – that they experience fewer complications like kidney problems and eye problems.[84][85] There is however debate as to whether this is cost effective for people later in life.[86]
</p><p>There are a number of different classes of anti-diabetic medications. Some are available by mouth, such as metformin, while others are only available by injection such as GLP-1 agonists. Type 1 diabetes can only be treated with insulin, typically with a combination of regular and NPH insulin, or synthetic insulin analogs.[citation needed]
</p><p>Metformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment for type 2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.[6] It works by decreasing the liver's production of glucose.[87] Several other groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, may also decrease blood sugar in type II DM. These include agents that increase insulin release, agents that decrease absorption of sugar from the intestines, and agents that make the body more sensitive to insulin.[87] When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.[6] Doses of insulin are then increased to effect.[6][88]
</p><h4>Blood pressure[edit]</h4><p>Since cardiovascular disease is a serious complication associated with diabetes, some have recommended blood pressure levels below 130/80 mmHg.[89] However, evidence supports less than or equal to somewhere between 140/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg; the only additional benefit found for blood pressure targets beneath this range was an isolated decrease in stroke risk, and this was accompanied by an increased risk of other serious adverse events.[90][91] A 2016 review found potential harm to treating lower than 140 mmHg.[92] Among medications that lower blood pressure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improve outcomes in those with DM while the similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not.[93] Aspirin is also recommended for people with cardiovascular problems, however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.[94]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Weight loss surgery in those with obesity and type two diabetes is often an effective measure.[14] Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medications following surgery[95] and long-term mortality is decreased.[96] There is, however, a short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery.[97] The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear.[96] It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control.[98]
</p><p>A pancreas transplant is occasionally considered for people with type 1 diabetes who have severe complications of their disease, including end stage kidney disease requiring kidney transplantation.[99]
</p><h3>Support[edit]</h3><p>In countries using a general practitioner system, such as the United Kingdom, care may take place mainly outside hospitals, with hospital-based specialist care used only in case of complications, difficult blood sugar control, or research projects. In other circumstances, general practitioners and specialists share care in a team approach. Home telehealth support can be an effective management technique.[100]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Inhalable insulin has been developed.[125] The original products were withdrawn due to side effects.[125] Afrezza, under development by the pharmaceuticals company MannKind Corporation, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for general sale in June 2014.[126] An advantage to inhaled insulin is that it may be more convenient and easy to use.[127]
</p><p>Transdermal insulin in the form of a cream has been developed and trials are being conducted on people with type 2 diabetes.[128][129]
</p><h3>Major clinical trials[edit]</h3><p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was a clinical study conducted by the United States National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993. Test subjects all had diabetes mellitus type 1 and were randomized to a tight glycemic arm and a control arm with the standard of care at the time; people were followed for an average of seven years, and people in the treatment had dramatically lower rates of diabetic complications.  It was as a landmark study at the time, and significantly changed the management of all forms of diabetes.[86][130][131]
</p><p>The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a clinical study conducted by Z that was published in The Lancet in 1998. Around 3,800 people with type 2 diabetes were followed for an average of ten years, and were treated with tight glucose control or the standard of care, and again the treatment arm had far better outcomes.  This confirmed the importance of tight glucose control, as well as blood pressure control, for people with this condition.[86][132][133]
</p>"
8,Gastroenteritis,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div> Percentage of rotavirus tests with positive results, by surveillance week, United States, July 2000 – June 2009.</div><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[43]
Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]
</p><h3>Vaccination</h3><p>Due to both its effectiveness and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that the rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally.[25][44] Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development.[44] In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants[44] and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen a decline in the rates and severity of disease.[45][46] This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections.[47] Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent.[48][49][50] The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age.[25] The oral cholera vaccine has been found to be 50–60% effective over 2 years.[51]
</p><h2>Management</h2><p>Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limiting disease that does not require medication.[22] The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT).[24] For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful,[52] and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.[53]
</p><h3>Rehydration</h3><p>The primary treatment of gastroenteritis in both children and adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required if there is a decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe.[54][55] Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars.[56] Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea.[22] Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them.[22] A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.[13] In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.[57]
</p><h3>Dietary</h3><p>It is recommended that breast-fed infants continue to be nursed in the usual fashion,  and that formula-fed infants continue their formula immediately after rehydration with ORT.[58] Lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas usually are not necessary.[58] Children should continue their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea with the exception that foods high in simple sugars should be avoided.[58] The BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and tea) is no longer recommended, as it contains insufficient nutrients and has no benefit over normal feeding.[58]
</p><p>Some probiotics have been shown to be beneficial in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools.[59][60] They may also be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea.[61] Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial.[62] Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.[63]
</p><h3>Antiemetics</h3><p>Antiemetic medications may be helpful for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting.[52][64][65][66] Metoclopramide might also be helpful.[66] However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children.[67] The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants.[68] Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, does not appear to have a significant clinical benefit.[1]
</p><h3>Antibiotics</h3><p>Antibiotics are not usually used for gastroenteritis, although they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe[69] or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected.[70] If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates of resistance to the latter.[19] Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin.[71] Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella[72] Salmonella typhi,[73] and Giardia species.[35] In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole.[35][74][needs update] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.[1]
</p><h3>Antimotility agents</h3><p>Antimotility medication has a theoretical risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown this to be unlikely,[42] these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever.[75] Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea.[76] Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, can be used in mild to moderate cases,[42] but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.[1]
</p><h2>Research</h2><p>There are a number of vaccines against gastroenteritis in development. For example, vaccines against Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), two of the leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis worldwide.[84][85]
</p>"
9,Bronchial Asthma,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[124] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[125][126] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[124]
</p><p>Early pet exposure may be useful.[127] Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive[128] and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.[129]
</p><p>Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended.[129] Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.[111] It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affects the risk of exacerbations.[130] Immunization; however, is recommended by the World Health Organization.[131] Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.[132]
</p><h2>Management</h2><p>While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved.[133] A specific, customized plan for proactively monitoring and managing symptoms should be created. This plan should include the reduction of exposure to allergens, testing to assess the severity of symptoms, and the usage of medications. The treatment plan should be written down and advise adjustments to treatment according to changes in symptoms.[134]
</p><p>The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets, or aspirin, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended.  Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.[135][136]
</p><p>Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended. For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments.[7]
</p><p>People with asthma have higher rates of anxiety and depression.[137] This is associated with poorer asthma control.[137] Cognitive behavioral therapy may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma.[137]
</p><h3>Lifestyle modification</h3><p>Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include allergens, smoke (from tobacco or other sources), air pollution, non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods.[138][139] Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.[140] Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma.[141] Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms.[56] Overall, exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma.[142] Yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.[143]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.[135] Antibiotics are generally not needed for sudden worsening of symptoms.[144]
</p><h4>Fast–acting</h4><div> Salbutamol metered dose inhaler commonly used to treat asthma attacks.</div><ul>Short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (SABA), such as salbutamol (albuterol USAN) are the first line treatment for asthma symptoms.[7] They are recommended before exercise in those with exercise induced symptoms.[145]
Anticholinergic medications, such as ipratropium bromide, provide additional benefit when used in combination with SABA in those with moderate or severe symptoms.[7] Anticholinergic bronchodilators can also be used if a person cannot tolerate a SABA.[94] If a child requires admission to hospital additional ipratropium does not appear to help over a SABA.[146]
Older, less selective adrenergic agonists, such as inhaled epinephrine, have similar efficacy to SABAs.[147] They are however not recommended due to concerns regarding excessive cardiac stimulation.[148]</ul><h4>Long–term control</h4><div> Fluticasone propionate metered dose inhaler commonly used for long-term control.</div><ul>Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[135] Inhaled forms such as beclomethasone are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[135] It is usually recommended that inhaled formulations be used once or twice daily, depending on the severity of symptoms.[149]
Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[150][151] In children this benefit is uncertain.[150][152][151] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[153] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[154][155] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[156] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[156]
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[17][135][157][158] Evidence is insufficient to support use in acute exacerbations.[159][160]  For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[158] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[161]  In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids by the British Thoracic Society in 2009.[162] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[163] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[17][164] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[17]
Intravenous administration of the drug aminophylline does not provide an improvement in bronchodilation when compared to standard inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[165] Aminophylline treatment is associated with more adverse effects compared to inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[165]
Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are another non-preferred alternative to corticosteroids.[135]
For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[166] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[167] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[167] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[167]</ul><h4>Delivery methods</h4><p>Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[168] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[169]
</p><h4>Adverse effects</h4><p>Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[170] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[170][171][172] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[173]
</p><h3>Others</h3><p>When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. For emergency management other options include:
</p><ul>Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.[174]
Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone.[175] One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.[176]
Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks.[18][177][178] In adults it results in a reduction of hospital admissions.[179]
Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.[18]
Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.[174]
Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.[174] Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.[180]
The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.[181]
For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[182] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[182][183] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.[184]
Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[185]
Omalizumab may also be useful in those with poorly controlled allergic asthma.[186]
It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[187]</ul><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[188][189] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.  Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C.[190] There is tentative support for its use in exercise induced bronchospasm.[191] In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation is likely to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations.[192]
</p><p>Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[193][194] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[195]
</p><p>Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[196]  The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[136]  Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[193]
</p>"
10,Hypertension ,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Much of the disease burden of high blood pressure is experienced by people who are not labeled as hypertensive.[87] Consequently, population strategies are required to reduce the consequences of high blood pressure and reduce the need for antihypertensive medications. Lifestyle changes are recommended to lower blood pressure, before starting medications. The 2004 British Hypertension Society guidelines[87] proposed lifestyle changes consistent with those outlined by the US National High BP Education Program in 2002[95] for the primary prevention of hypertension:
</p><ul>maintain normal body weight for adults (e.g. body mass index 20–25 kg/m2)
reduce dietary sodium intake to <100 mmol/ day (<6 g of sodium chloride or <2.4 g of sodium per day)
engage in regular aerobic physical activity such as brisk walking (≥30 min per day, most days of the week)
limit alcohol consumption to no more than 3 units/day in men and no more than 2 units/day in women
consume a diet rich in fruit and vegetables (e.g. at least five portions per day);</ul><p>Effective lifestyle modification may lower blood pressure as much as an individual antihypertensive medication. Combinations of two or more lifestyle modifications can achieve even better results.[87] There is considerable evidence that reducing dietary salt intake lowers blood pressure, but whether this translates into a reduction in mortality and cardiovascular disease remains uncertain.[96] Estimated sodium intake ≥6g/day and <3g/day are both associated with high risk of death or major cardiovascular disease, but the association between high sodium intake and adverse outcomes is only observed in people with hypertension.[97] Consequently, in the absence of results from randomized controlled trials, the wisdom of reducing levels of dietary salt intake below 3g/day has been questioned.[96] ESC guidelines mention periodontitis is associated with poor cardiovascular health status.[98]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of hypertension</div><p>According to one review published in 2003, reduction of the blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischemic heart disease by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease.[99]
</p><h3>Target blood pressure[edit]</h3><div>See also: Comparison of international blood pressure guidelines</div><p>Various expert groups have produced guidelines regarding how low the blood pressure target should be when a person is treated for hypertension. These groups recommend a target below the range 140–160 / 90–100 mmHg for the general population.[13][12][100][101][102] Cochrane reviews recommend similar targets for subgroups such as people with diabetes[103] and people with prior cardiovascular disease.[104]
</p><p>Many expert groups recommend a slightly higher target of 150/90 mmHg for those over somewhere between 60 and 80 years of age.[12][100][101][105] The JNC-8 and American College of Physicians recommend the target of 150/90 mmHg for those over 60 years of age,[13][106] but some experts within these groups disagree with this recommendation.[107] Some expert groups have also recommended slightly lower targets in those with diabetes[12] or chronic kidney disease with protein loss in the urine,[108] but others recommend the same target as for the general population.[13][103] The issue of what is the best target and whether targets should differ for high risk individuals is unresolved,[109] although some experts propose more intensive blood pressure lowering than advocated in some guidelines.[110]
</p><p>For people who have never experienced cardiovascular disease who are at a 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease of less than 10%, the 2017 American Heart Association guidelines recommend medications if the systolic blood pressure is >140 mmHg or if the diastolic BP is >90 mmHg.[7] For people who have experienced cardiovascular disease or those who are at a 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease of greater than 10%, it recommends medications if the systolic blood pressure is >130 mmHg or if the diastolic BP is >80 mmHg.[7]
</p><h3>Lifestyle modifications[edit]</h3><p>The first line of treatment for hypertension is lifestyle changes, including dietary changes, physical exercise, and weight loss. Though these have all been recommended in scientific advisories,[111] a  Cochrane systematic review found no evidence for effects of weight loss diets on death, long-term complications or adverse events in persons with hypertension.[112] The review did find a decrease in blood pressure.[112] Their potential effectiveness is similar to and at times exceeds a single medication.[12] If hypertension is high enough to justify immediate use of medications, lifestyle changes are still recommended in conjunction with medication.
</p><p>Dietary changes shown to reduce blood pressure include diets with low sodium,[113][114][115] the DASH diet,[116] vegetarian diets,[117] and green tea consumption.[118][119][120][121]
</p><p>Increasing dietary potassium has a potential benefit for lowering the risk of hypertension.[122][123] The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) stated that potassium is one of the shortfall nutrients which is under-consumed in the United States.[124] However, people who take certain antihypertensive medications (such as ACE-inhibitors or ARBs) should not take potassium supplements or potassium-enriched salts due to the risk of high levels of potassium.[125]
</p><p>Physical exercise regimens which are shown to reduce blood pressure include isometric resistance exercise, aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and device-guided breathing.[126]
</p><p>Stress reduction techniques such as biofeedback or transcendental meditation may be considered as an add-on to other treatments to reduce hypertension, but do not have evidence for preventing cardiovascular disease on their own.[126][127][128] Self-monitoring and appointment reminders might support the use of other strategies to improve blood pressure control, but need further evaluation.[129]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as antihypertensive medications, are available for treating hypertension.
</p><p>First-line medications for hypertension include thiazide-diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).[13] These medications may be used alone or in combination (ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended for use in combination); the latter option may serve to minimize counter-regulatory mechanisms that act to restore blood pressure values to pre-treatment levels.[13][130] Most people require more than one medication to control their hypertension.[111] Medications for blood pressure control should be implemented by a stepped care approach when target levels are not reached.[129]
</p><p>Previously beta-blockers such as atenolol were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, a Cochrane review that included 13 trials found that the effects of beta-blockers are inferior to that of other antihypertensive medications in preventing cardiovascular disease.[131]
</p><h3>Resistant hypertension[edit]</h3><p>Resistant hypertension is defined as high blood pressure that remains above a target level, in spite of being prescribed three or more antihypertensive drugs simultaneously with different mechanisms of action.[132] Failing to take the prescribed drugs, is an important cause of resistant hypertension.[133] Resistant hypertension may also result from chronically high activity of the autonomic nervous system, an effect known as ""neurogenic hypertension"".[134] Electrical therapies that stimulate the baroreflex are being studied as an option for lowering blood pressure in people in this situation.[135]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>A 2015 review of several studies found that restoring blood vitamin D levels by using supplements (more than 1,000 IU per day) reduced blood pressure in hypertensive individuals when they had existing vitamin D deficiency.[168] The results also demonstrated a correlation of chronically low vitamin D levels with a higher chance of becoming hypertensive. Supplementation with vitamin D over 18 months in normotensive individuals with vitamin D deficiency did not significantly affect blood pressure.[168]
</p><p>There is tentative evidence that an increased calcium intake may help in preventing hypertension. However, more studies are needed to assess the optimal dose and the possible side effects.[169]

11,Migraine,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Prevention of migraines</div><p>Preventive treatments of migraines include medications, nutritional supplements, lifestyle alterations, and surgery. Prevention is recommended in those who have headaches more than two days a week, cannot tolerate the medications used to treat acute attacks, or those with severe attacks that are not easily controlled.[10]
</p><p>The goal is to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and/or duration of migraines, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy.[86] Another reason for prevention is to avoid medication overuse headache. This is a common problem and can result in chronic daily headache.[87][88]
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>Preventive migraine medications are considered effective if they reduce the frequency or severity of the migraine attacks by at least 50%.[89] Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating topiramate, divalproex/sodium valproate, propranolol, and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence for first-line use.[90] Recommendations regarding effectiveness varied however for gabapentin and pregabalin.[90] Timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity, while frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine.[90] Tentative evidence also supports the use of magnesium supplementation.[91] Increasing dietary intake may be better.[92]
</p><p>Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are probably also effective.[93] Angiotensin inhibition by either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist may reduce attacks.[94]
</p><p>Medications in the anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide, including eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, appear to decrease the frequency of migraines by one to two per month.[95]
</p><h3>Alternative therapies[edit]</h3><p>While acupuncture may be effective in reducing the number of migraines, ""true"" acupuncture has only a small effect when compared to sham acupuncture, a practice where needles are placed randomly or do not penetrate the skin.[96] Both have a possibility of being similar in effectiveness to preventative medications with fewer adverse effects, however the long term effects of most migraine treatments are not known.[96] Chiropractic manipulation, physiotherapy, massage and relaxation might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches; however, the research had some problems with methodology.[97] The evidence to support spinal manipulation is poor and insufficient to support its use.[98]
</p><p>Tentative evidence supports the use of stress reduction techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques.[56] Of the alternative medicines, butterbur has the best evidence for its use.[99][100] The supplement melatonin also has modest evidence supporting its use as an add on therapy for prevention and treatment of migraine.[101] The data supporting melatonin is mixed and certain studies have had negative results.[101] The reasons for the mixed findings are unclear but may stem from differences in study design and melatonin dosage.[101] Melatonin's mechanism of action in migraine are not completely clear, however, may include improved sleep, direct action on melatonin receptors in the brain, and anti-inflammatory properties.[101][102]
</p><h3>Devices and surgery[edit]</h3><p>Medical devices, such as biofeedback and neurostimulators, have some advantages in migraine prevention, mainly when common anti-migraine medications are contraindicated or in case of medication overuse. Biofeedback helps people be conscious of some physiological parameters so as to control them and try to relax and may be efficient for migraine treatment.[103][104] Neurostimulation uses noninvasive or implantable neurostimulators similar to pacemakers for the treatment of intractable chronic migraines with encouraging results for severe cases.[105][106] A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator and a transcranial magnetic stimulator are approved in the United States for the prevention of migraines.[107][108] Migraine surgery, which involves decompression of certain nerves around the head and neck, may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medications.[109]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>There are three main aspects of treatment: trigger avoidance, acute symptomatic control, and medication for prevention.[5] Medications are more effective if used earlier in an attack.[5] The frequent use of medications may result in medication overuse headache, in which the headaches become more severe and more frequent.[12] This may occur with triptans, ergotamines, and analgesics, especially opioid analgesics.[12] Due to these concerns simple analgesics are recommended to be used less than three days per week at most.[110]
</p><h3>Analgesics[edit]</h3><p>Recommended initial treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms are simple analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the combination of paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), aspirin, and caffeine.[10] Several NSAIDs, including diclofenac and ibuprofen have evidence to support their use.[111][112] Aspirin can relieve moderate to severe migraine pain, with an effectiveness similar to sumatriptan.[113] Ketorolac is available in an intravenous formulation.[10]
</p><p>Paracetamol, either alone or in combination with metoclopramide, is another effective treatment with a low risk of adverse effects.[114] Intravenous metoclopramide is also effective by itself.[115][116] In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester.[10]
</p><h3>Triptans[edit]</h3><p>Triptans such as sumatriptan are effective for both pain and nausea in up to 75% of people.[5][117] When sumatriptan is taken with naproxen it works better.[118] They are the initially recommended treatments for those with moderate to severe pain or those with milder symptoms who do not respond to simple analgesics.[10] The different forms available include oral, injectable, nasal spray, and oral dissolving tablets.[5] In general, all the triptans appear equally effective, with similar side effects. However, individuals may respond better to specific ones.[10] Most side effects are mild, such as flushing; however, rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred.[5] They are thus not recommended for people with cardiovascular disease,[10] who have had a stroke, or have migraines that are accompanied by neurological problems.[119] In addition, triptans should be prescribed with caution for those with risk factors for vascular disease.[119] While historically not recommended in those with basilar migraines there is no specific evidence of harm from their use in this population to support this caution.[37] They are not addictive, but may cause medication-overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month.[120]
</p><h3>Ergotamines[edit]</h3><p>Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are older medications still prescribed for migraines, the latter in nasal spray and injectable forms.[5][121] They appear equally effective to the triptans[122] and experience adverse effects that typically are benign.[123] In the most severe cases, such as those with status migrainosus, they appear to be the most effective treatment option.[123] They can cause vasospasm including coronary vasospasm and are contraindicated in people with coronary artery disease.[124]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>Intravenous metoclopramide, intravenous prochlorperazine, or intranasal lidocaine are other potential options.[10][116] Metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are the recommended treatment for those who present to the emergency department.[10][116] Haloperidol may also be useful in this group.[116][121] A single dose of intravenous dexamethasone, when added to standard treatment of a migraine attack, is associated with a 26% decrease in headache recurrence in the following 72 hours.[125] Spinal manipulation for treating an ongoing migraine headache is not supported by evidence.[126] It is recommended that opioids and barbiturates not be used due to questionable efficacy, addictive potential, and the risk of rebound headache.[10]
</p><h3>Children[edit]</h3><p>Ibuprofen helps decrease pain in children with migraines. Paracetamol does not appear to be effective in providing pain relief. Triptans are effective, though there is a risk of causing minor side effects like taste disturbance, nasal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, low energy, nausea, or vomiting.[127]
</p><h3>Chronic migraine[edit]</h3><p>Topiramate and botulinum toxin (Botox) are the only medications with evidence in treating chronic migraine.[93] Botulinum toxin has been found to be useful in those with chronic migraines but not those with episodic ones.[128][129]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Calcitonin gene related peptides (CGRPs) have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine.[10] CGRP receptor antagonists, such as olcegepant and telcagepant, have been investigated both in vitro and in clinical studies for the treatment of migraine.[149] In 2011, Merck stopped phase III clinical trials for their investigational drug telcagepant.[150][151] Research as of 2016 is looking at CGRP monoclonal antibodies, of which four are in phase II development, three targeting CGRP itself and one targeting the receptor.[152] Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows promise[10][153] as does transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation.[154] There is preliminary evidence that a ketogenic diet may help prevent episodic and long-term migraine.[155]
</p><div></div>"
12,Cervical spondylosis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment is usually conservative in nature. Patient education on lifestyle modifications, chiropractic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, and osteopathic care are common forms of manual care that help manage such conditions.[6] Other alternative therapies such as massage, trigger-point therapy, yoga and acupuncture may be of limited benefit.[6] Surgery is occasionally performed.
</p><p>Many of the treatments for cervical spondylosis have not been subjected to rigorous, controlled trials.[7] Surgery is advocated for cervical radiculopathy in patients who have intractable pain, progressive symptoms, or weakness that fails to improve with conservative therapy. Surgical indications for cervical spondylosis with myelopathy (CSM) remain somewhat controversial, but ""most clinicians recommend operative therapy over conservative therapy for moderate-to-severe myelopathy"" (Baron, M.E.).
</p><p>Physical therapy may be effective for restoring range of motion, flexibility and core strengthening. Decompressive therapies (i.e. manual mobilization, mechanical traction) may also help alleviate pain. However, physical therapy and osteopathy cannot ""cure"" the degeneration, and some people view that strong compliance with postural modification is necessary to realize maximum benefit from decompression, adjustments and flexibility rehabilitation.
</p><p>It has been argued, however, that the cause of spondylosis is simply old age (even though it can present in any age), and that posture modification treatment is often practiced by those who have a financial interest (such as Worker's Compensation)[8] in proving that it is caused by work conditions and poor physical habits. Understanding anatomy is the key to conservative management of spondylosis.
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Current surgical procedures used to treat spondylosis aim to alleviate the signs and symptoms of the disease by decreasing pressure in the spinal canal (decompression surgery) and/or by controlling spine movement (fusion surgery).[9]
</p><p>Decompression surgery: The vertebral column can be operated on from both an anterior and posterior approach. The approach varies depending on the site and cause of root compression. Commonly, osteophytes and portions of intervertebral disc are removed.[10]
</p><p>Fusion surgery: Performed when there is evidence of spinal instability or mal-alignment. Use of instrumentation (such as pedicle screws) in fusion surgeries varies across studies.[9]
</p>"
13,Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment depends substantially on the type of ICH. Rapid CT scan and other diagnostic measures are used to determine proper treatment, which may include both medication and surgery.
</p><ul>Tracheal intubation is indicated in people with decreased level of consciousness or other risk of airway obstruction.[17]
IV fluids are given to maintain fluid balance, using isotonic rather than hypotonic fluids.[17]</ul><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><ul>One review found that antihypertensive therapy to bring down the blood pressure in acute phases appears to improve outcomes.[18] Other reviews found an unclear difference between intensive and less intensive blood pressure control.[19][20] The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association guidelines in 2015 recommended decreasing the blood pressure to a SBP of 140 mmHg.[1] However, the evidence finds tentative usefulness as of 2015.[21]
Giving Factor VIIa within 4 hours limits the bleeding and formation of a hematoma. However, it also increases the risk of thromboembolism.[17] It thus overall does not result in better outcomes in those without hemophilia.[22]
Frozen plasma, vitamin K, protamine, or platelet transfusions may be given in case of a coagulopathy.[17] Platelets however appear to worsen outcomes in those with spontaneous intracerebral bleeding on antiplatelet medication.[23]
Fosphenytoin or other anticonvulsant is given in case of seizures or lobar hemorrhage.[17]
H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors are commonly given for to try to prevent stress ulcers, a condition linked with ICH.[17]
Corticosteroids, were thought to reduce swelling. However, in large controlled studies, corticosteroids have been found to increase mortality rates and are no longer recommended.[24][25]</ul><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Surgery is required if the hematoma is greater than 3 cm (1 in), if there is a structural vascular lesion or lobar hemorrhage in a young patient.[17]
</p><ul>A catheter may be passed into the brain vasculature to close off or dilate blood vessels, avoiding invasive surgical procedures.[26]
Aspiration by stereotactic surgery or endoscopic drainage may be used in basal ganglia hemorrhages, although successful reports are limited.[17]
A craniectomy may take place, where part of the skull is removed to allow a swelling brain room to expand without being squeezed.</ul><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>The inflammatory response triggered by stroke has been viewed as harmful in the early stage, focusing on blood-borne leukocytes, neutrophils and macrophages, and resident microglia and astrocytes.[32] A human postmortem study shows that inflammation occurs early and persists for several days after ICH.[33] Modulating microglial activation and polarization might mitigate intracerebral hemorrhage-induced brain injury and improve brain repair.[34] A new area of interest is the role of mast cells in ICH.[35]

14,Jaundice,"Treatment
Medication
Medication or supplements can help jaundice depending on the cause.

Treatment will depend on the underlying cause.

Jaundice treatment targets the cause rather than the jaundice symptoms.

The following treatments are used:

    Anemia-induced jaundice may be treated by boosting the amount of iron in the blood by either taking iron supplements or eating more iron-rich foods. Iron supplements are available for purchase online.
    Hepatitis-induced jaundice requires antiviral or steroid medications.
    Doctors can treat obstruction-induced jaundice by surgically removing the obstruction.
    If the jaundice has been caused by use of a medication, treatment for involves changing to an alternative medication.

Prevention
Jaundice is related to liver function. It is essential that people maintain the health of this vital organ by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and not consuming more than the recommended amounts of alcohol."
15,Malaria,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div> An Anopheles stephensi mosquito shortly after obtaining blood from a human (the droplet of blood is expelled as a surplus). This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence.</div><p>Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.[62]
</p><p>Prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.[63]
</p><p>In areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have anemia, which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalization.[64]
</p><h3>Mosquito control</h3><div>Further information: Mosquito control</div><div> Man spraying kerosene oil in standing water, Panama Canal Zone 1912</div><p>Vector control refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective insect repellents are based on DEET or picaridin.[65] Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) have been shown highly effective in preventing malaria among children in areas where malaria is common.[66][67] Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.[68]
</p><div> Walls where indoor residual spraying of DDT has been applied. The mosquitoes remain on the wall until they fall down dead on the floor.</div><div> A mosquito net in use.</div><p>Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets, and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.[69] Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa.[70] About 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007[71] and 31% of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008. In 2000, 1.7 million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected[72] and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015.[73]  Most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides with low toxicity. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.[74] It is recommended to hang a large ""bed net"" above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground.[75]
</p><p>Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite.[76] As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin.[77] This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use.[78] One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.[79]
</p><p>People have tried a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water where they develop, or by adding substances to decrease their development, is effective in some locations.[80] Electronic mosquito repellent devices, which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, have no supporting evidence of effectiveness.[81]
</p><h3>Other methods</h3><p>Community participation and health education strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world.[82]  Recognizing the disease in the early stages can prevent the disease from becoming fatal.  Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.[83] Intermittent preventive therapy is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants,[84] and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.[85]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><div>Main article: Malaria prophylaxis</div><p>There are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these medications are also used in treatment. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine, doxycycline, or the combination of atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone)—are frequently used for prevention.[86] Doxycycline and the atovaquone/proguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week.[86] Areas of the world with chloroquine sensitive malaria are uncommon.[87]
</p><p>The protective effect does not begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before they arrive, and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward).[88] The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations.[89] During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother.[90] The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.[91]
</p><h2>Treatment</h2><div> An advertisement for quinine as a malaria treatment from 1927.</div><p>Malaria is treated with antimalarial medications; the ones used depends on the type and severity of the disease. While medications against fever are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear.[92]
</p><p>Simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P. falciparum infection is the use of artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component.[93] These additional antimalarials include: amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.[94] Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine.[95][96] ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria.[70] To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters).[97] In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia.[98][99] Infection with P. vivax, P. ovale or P. malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P. vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with primaquine.[100] Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.[101]
</p><p>Severe and complicated malaria are almost always caused by infection with P. falciparum. The other species usually cause only febrile disease.[102] Severe and complicated malaria are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high (10% to 50%).[103] Cerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms.[104]
Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults.[105] In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children.[106] Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.[24]
</p><h3>Resistance</h3><p>Drug resistance poses a growing problem in 21st-century malaria treatment.[107] Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world.[108] Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable.[109] Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype.[110] Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam,[111] and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.[112][113]
</p><h2>Research</h2><p>The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative was a consultative process to identify which areas of research and development (R&D) must be addressed for worldwide eradication of malaria.[193][194]
</p><h3>Vaccine</h3><div>See also: Malaria vaccine</div><p>A vaccine against malaria called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.[165] It is undergoing pilot trials in select countries in 2016.
</p><p>Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P. falciparum malaria does occur naturally, but only in response to years of repeated infection.[38] An individual can be protected from a P. falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation.[195] The highly polymorphic nature of many P. falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.[196] Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.[197] For example, SPf66  was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.[198]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles usually found in plants, complete with their own genomes. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.[199]
</p><p>With the onset of drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxal-amino acid adducts, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins.[200][201] Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metal-based complexes are attracting research interest.[202][203]
</p><ul>(+)-SJ733: Part of a wider class of experimental drugs called spiroindolone.  It inhibits the ATP4 protein of infected red blood cells that cause the cells to shrink and become rigid like the aging cells. This triggers the immune system to eliminate the infected cells from the system as demonstrated in a mouse model.  As of 2014, a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety profile in human is planned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[204]
NITD246 and NITD609: Also belonged to the class of spiroindolone and target the ATP4 protein.[204]</ul><h3>Other</h3><p>A non-chemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.[69]
</p><p>Genomics is central to malaria research. With the sequencing of P. falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can be studied.[205] Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission.[206]
</p><p>In one study, a genetically-modified strain of Anopheles stephensi was created that no longer supported malaria transmission, and this resistance was passed down to mosquito offspring.[207]
</p><p>Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat or eliminate insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria, zika,[208] dengue and yellow fever).[191]

16,Chicken pox,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Hygiene measures[edit]</h3><p>The spread of chickenpox can be prevented by isolating affected individuals. Contagion is by exposure to respiratory droplets, or direct contact with lesions, within a period lasting from three days before the onset of the rash, to four days after the onset of the rash.[35] The chickenpox virus is susceptible to disinfectants, notably chlorine bleach (i.e., sodium hypochlorite). Like all enveloped viruses, it is sensitive to desiccation, heat and detergents.
</p><h3>Vaccine[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Varicella vaccine</div><p>The varicella vaccine is recommended in many countries.[10] Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. A second dose is recommended five years after the initial immunization.[36] A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if they become infected.[37] Immunization within three days following household contact reduces infection rates and severity in children.[11]
</p><p>It is part of the routine immunization schedule in the US.[38] Some European countries include it as part of universal vaccinations in children,[39] but not all countries provide the vaccine due to its cost.[10] In the UK as of 2014, the vaccine is only recommended in people who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox.  This is to keep the virus in circulation thereby exposing the population to the virus at an early age, when it is less harmful, and to reduce the occurrence of shingles in those who have already had chickenpox by repeated exposure to the virus later in life.[40] In populations that have not been immunized or if immunity is questionable, a clinician may order an enzyme immunoassay. An immunoassay measures the levels of antibodies against the virus that give immunity to a person. If the levels of antibodies are low (low titer) or questionable, reimmunization may be done.[41]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment mainly consists of easing the symptoms. As a protective measure, people are usually required to stay at home while they are infectious to avoid spreading the disease to others. Cutting the nails short or wearing gloves may prevent scratching and minimize the risk of secondary infections.
</p><p>Although there have been no formal clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of topical application of calamine lotion (a topical barrier preparation containing zinc oxide, and one of the most commonly used interventions), it has an excellent safety profile.[42] It is important to maintain good hygiene and daily cleaning of skin with warm water to avoid secondary bacterial infection.[43] Scratching may also increase the risk of secondary infection.[44]
</p><p>Paracetamol (acetaminophen) but not aspirin may be used to reduce fever. Aspirin use by someone with chickenpox may cause the serious, sometimes fatal disease of the liver and brain, Reye syndrome. People at risk of developing severe complications who have had significant exposure to the virus may be given intra-muscular varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a preparation containing high titres of antibodies to varicella zoster virus, to ward off the disease.[45][46]
</p><p>Antivirals are sometimes used.[47][48]
</p><h3>Children[edit]</h3><p>If aciclovir by mouth is started within 24 hours of rash onset, it decreases symptoms by one day but has no effect on complication rates.[49][50] Use of acyclovir therefore is not currently recommended for individuals with normal immune function. Children younger than 12 years old and older than one month are not meant to receive antiviral drugs unless they have another medical condition which puts them at risk of developing complications.[51]
</p><p>Treatment of chickenpox in children is aimed at symptoms while the immune system deals with the virus. With children younger than 12 years, cutting nails and keeping them clean is an important part of treatment as they are more likely to scratch their blisters more deeply than adults.[52]
</p><p>Aspirin is highly contraindicated in children younger than 16 years, as it has been related to Reye syndrome.[53]
</p><h3>Adults[edit]</h3><p>Infection in otherwise healthy adults tends to be more severe.[54] Treatment with antiviral drugs (e.g. aciclovir or valaciclovir) is generally advised, as long as it is started within 24–48 hours from rash onset.[51] Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used for children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication, as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. Antiviral medicines do not kill the virus but stop it from multiplying. Adults are advised to increase water intake to reduce dehydration and to relieve headaches. Painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are recommended, as they are effective in relieving itching and other symptoms such as fever or pains. Antihistamines relieve itching and may be used in cases where the itching prevents sleep, because they also act as a sedative. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those adults who are more prone to develop complications. These include pregnant women or people who have a weakened immune system.[55]
</p><p>Sorivudine, a nucleoside analog, has been reported to be effective in the treatment of primary varicella in healthy adults (case reports only), but large-scale clinical trials are still needed to demonstrate its efficacy.[56]

17,Dengue,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div> A 1920s photograph of efforts to disperse standing water and thus decrease mosquito populations</div><p>Prevention depends on control of and protection from the bites of the mosquito that transmits it.[34][54] The World Health Organization recommends an Integrated Vector Control program consisting of five elements:[34]
</p><ol>Advocacy, social mobilization and legislation to ensure that public health bodies and communities are strengthened;
Collaboration between the health and other sectors (public and private);
An integrated approach to disease control to maximize use of resources;
Evidence-based decision making to ensure any interventions are targeted appropriately; and
Capacity-building to ensure an adequate response to the local situation.</ol><p>The primary method of controlling A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats.[34] This is done by getting rid of open sources of water, or if this is not possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas.[34] Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective.[21] Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents.[34] People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective).[38] While these measures can be an effective means of reducing an individual's risk of exposure, they do little in terms of mitigating the frequency of outbreaks, which appear to be on the rise in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti.[7] The range of the disease also appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.[7]
</p><h3>Vaccine</h3><p>In 2016 a partially effective vaccine for dengue fever became commercially available in the Philippines and Indonesia.[4][55] It has also been approved for use by Mexico, Brazil, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Paraguay.[55][56] In Indonesia it costs about US$207 for the recommended three doses.[55]
</p><p>The vaccine is produced by Sanofi and goes by the brand name Dengvaxia.[57] It is based on a weakened combination of the yellow fever virus and each of the four dengue serotypes.[35][58] Two studies of a vaccine found it was 60% effective and prevented more than 80 to 90% of severe cases.[59][60] This is less than wished for by some.[61] As of 2017 the vaccine is only to be used in people who have previously had a dengue infection as otherwise there was evidence it may worsen subsequent infections.[62][9]
</p><p>There are ongoing programs working on a dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes.[54] Now that there is a fifth serotype this will need to be factored in.[7] One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).[63] The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.[63]
</p><h3>Anti-dengue day</h3><div> A poster in Tampines, Singapore, notifying people that there are 10 or more cases of dengue in the neighbourhood (November 2015).</div><p>International Anti-Dengue Day is observed every year on 15 June.[64] The idea was first agreed upon in 2010 with the first event held in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2011.[64] Further events were held in 2012 in Yangon, Myanmar and in 2013 in Vietnam.[64] Goals are to increase public awareness about dengue, mobilize resources for its prevention and control and, to demonstrate the Asian region's commitment in tackling the disease.[65]
</p><h2>Management</h2><p>There are no specific antiviral drugs for dengue; however, maintaining proper fluid balance is important.[24] Treatment depends on the symptoms.[11] Those who are able to drink, are passing urine, have no ""warning signs"" and are otherwise healthy can be managed at home with daily follow-up and oral rehydration therapy.[11] Those who have other health problems, have ""warning signs"", or cannot manage regular follow-up should be cared for in hospital.[12][11] In those with severe dengue care should be provided in an area where there is access to an intensive care unit.[11]
</p><p>Intravenous hydration, if required, is typically only needed for one or two days.[11] In children with shock due to dengue a rapid dose of 20 mL/kg is reasonable.[66] The rate of fluid administration is then titrated to a urinary output of 0.5–1 mL/kg/h, stable vital signs and normalization of hematocrit.[12] The smallest amount of fluid required to achieve this is recommended.[11]
</p><p>Invasive medical procedures such as nasogastric intubation, intramuscular injections and arterial punctures are avoided, in view of the bleeding risk.[12] Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is used for fever and discomfort while NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and aspirin are avoided as they might aggravate the risk of bleeding.[11] Blood transfusion is initiated early in people presenting with unstable vital signs in the face of a decreasing hematocrit, rather than waiting for the hemoglobin concentration to decrease to some predetermined ""transfusion trigger"" level.[67] Packed red blood cells or whole blood are recommended, while platelets and fresh frozen plasma are usually not.[67] There is not enough evidence to determine if corticosteroids have a positive or negative effect in dengue fever.[68]
</p><p>During the recovery phase intravenous fluids are discontinued to prevent a state of fluid overload.[12] If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed.[67] If a person is outside of the critical phase, a loop diuretic such as furosemide may be used to eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.[67]
</p><h2>Research</h2><div> Public health officers releasing P. reticulata fry into an artificial lake in the Lago Norte district of Brasília, Brazil, as part of a vector control effort</div><p>Research efforts to prevent and treat dengue include various means of vector control,[83] vaccine development, and antiviral drugs.[54]
</p><h3>Vector</h3><p>With regards to vector control, a number of novel methods have been used to reduce mosquito numbers with some success including the placement of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) or copepods in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae.[83] There are also trials with genetically modified male A. aegypti that after release into the wild mate with females, and render their offspring unable to fly.[84]
</p><h3>Wolbachia</h3><p>Attempts are ongoing to infect the mosquito population with bacteria of the genus Wolbachia, which makes the mosquitos partially resistant to dengue virus.[24][85] While artificially induced infection with Wolbachia is effective, it is unclear if naturally acquired infections are protective.[86] Work is still ongoing as of 2015[update] to determine the best type of Wolbachia to use.[87]
</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p>Apart from attempts to control the spread of the Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications.[17][88] Discovery of the structure of the viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs.[17] There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins.[89] Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.[88]

18,Typhoid,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div> Doctor administering a typhoid vaccination at a school in San Augustine County, Texas, 1943</div><p>Sanitation and hygiene are important to prevent typhoid. Typhoid can only spread in environments where human feces are able to come into contact with food or drinking water. Careful food preparation and washing of hands are crucial to prevent typhoid. Industrialization, and in particular, the invention of the automobile, contributed greatly to the elimination of typhoid fever, as it eliminated the public health hazards associated with having horse manure in the public street which led to large number of flies[22] which are known as vectors of many pathogens including Salmonellae.[23] According to statistics from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the chlorination of drinking water has led to dramatic decreases in the transmission of typhoid fever in the United States.[citation needed]
</p><h3>Vaccination[edit]</h3><p>Two typhoid vaccines are  licensed for use for the prevention of typhoid:[7] the live, oral Ty21a vaccine (sold as Vivotif by Crucell Switzerland AG) and the injectable typhoid polysaccharide vaccine (sold as Typhim Vi by Sanofi Pasteur and 'Typherix by GlaxoSmithKline). Both are efficacious and recommended for travellers to areas where typhoid is endemic. Boosters are recommended every five years for the oral vaccine and every two years for the injectable form.[24][needs update] An older, killed-whole-cell vaccine is still used in countries where the newer preparations are not available, but this vaccine is no longer recommended for use because it has a higher rate of side effects (mainly pain and inflammation at the site of the injection).[25]
</p><p>To help decrease rates of typhoid fever in developing nations, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the use of a vaccination program starting in 1999. Vaccinations have proven to be a great way at controlling outbreaks in high incidence areas. Just as important, it is also very cost-effective. Vaccination prices are normally low, less than US $1 per dose. Because the price is low, poverty-stricken communities are more willing to take advantage of the vaccinations.[26] Although vaccination programs for typhoid have proven to be effective, they alone cannot eliminate typhoid fever.[26] Combining the use of vaccines along with increasing public health efforts is the only proven way to control this disease.[26]
</p><p>Since the 1990s there have been two typhoid fever vaccines recommended by the World Health Organization. The ViPS vaccine is given via injection, while the Ty21a is taken through capsules. It is recommended only people 2 years or older be vaccinated with the ViPS vaccine and requires a revaccination after 2–3 years with a 55–72% vaccine efficacy. The alternative Ty21a vaccine is recommended for people 5 years or older, and has a 5-7-year duration with a 51–67% vaccine efficacy. The two different vaccines have been proven as a safe and effective treatment for epidemic disease control in multiple regions.[27]
</p><p>A version combined with hepatitis A is also available.[28]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><h3>Oral rehydration therapy[edit]</h3><p>The rediscovery of oral rehydration therapy in the 1960s provided a simple way to prevent many of the deaths of diarrheal diseases in general.
</p><h3>Antibiotics[edit]</h3><p>Where resistance is uncommon, the treatment of choice is a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.[29][30] Otherwise, a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is the first choice.[31][32][33][34] Cefixime is a suitable oral alternative.[35][36]
</p><p>Typhoid fever, when properly treated, is not fatal in most cases. Antibiotics, such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, have been commonly used to treat typhoid fever in microbiology.[37] Treatment of the disease with antibiotics reduces the case-fatality rate to about 1%.[38]
</p><p>Without treatment, some patients develop sustained fever, bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal symptoms and, occasionally, pneumonia. In white-skinned patients, pink spots, which fade on pressure, appear on the skin of the trunk in up to 20% of cases. In the third week, untreated cases may develop gastrointestinal and cerebral complications, which may prove fatal in up to 10–20% of cases. The highest case fatality rates are reported in children under 4 years. Around 2–5% of those who contract typhoid fever become chronic carriers, as bacteria persist in the biliary tract after symptoms have resolved.[39]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Surgery is usually indicated in cases of intestinal perforation. Most surgeons prefer simple closure of the perforation with drainage of the peritoneum. Small-bowel resection is indicated for patients with multiple perforations.
</p><p>If antibiotic treatment fails to eradicate the hepatobiliary carriage, the gallbladder should be resected. Cholecystectomy is not always successful in eradicating the carrier state because of persisting hepatic infection.
</p><h3>Resistance[edit]</h3><p>As resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and streptomycin is now common, these agents have not been used as first–line treatment of typhoid fever for almost 20 years.[citation needed] Typhoid resistant to these agents is known as multidrug-resistant typhoid (MDR typhoid).
</p><p>Ciprofloxacin resistance is an increasing problem, especially in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Many centres are shifting from using ciprofloxacin as the first line for treating suspected typhoid originating in South America, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, or Vietnam. For these people, the recommended first-line treatment is ceftriaxone. Also, azithromycin has been suggested to be better at treating typhoid in resistant populations than both fluoroquinolone drugs and ceftriaxone.[30] Azithromycin significantly reduces relapse rates compared with ceftriaxone.
</p><p>A separate problem exists with laboratory testing for reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin: current recommendations are that isolates should be tested simultaneously against ciprofloxacin (CIP) and against nalidixic acid (NAL), and that isolates that are sensitive to both CIP and NAL should be reported as ""sensitive to ciprofloxacin"", but that isolates testing sensitive to CIP but not to NAL should be reported as ""reduced sensitivity to ciprofloxacin"". However, an analysis of 271 isolates showed that around 18% of isolates with a reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC 0.125–1.0 mg/l) would not be picked up by this method.[40] How this problem can be solved is not certain, because most laboratories around the world (including the West) are dependent on disk testing and cannot test for MICs.
</p>"
19,hepatitis A,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div>For information about the vaccine, its properties, and its application, see Hepatitis A vaccine.</div><p>Hepatitis A can be prevented by vaccination, good hygiene, and sanitation.[6][40]
</p><h3>Vaccination[edit]</h3><p>The two types of vaccines contain either inactivated Hepatovirus A or a live but attenuated virus.[3] Both provide active immunity against a future infection. The vaccine protects against HAV in more than 95% of cases for longer than 25 years.[41] In the US, the vaccine was first used in 1996 for children in high-risk areas, and in 1999 it was spread to areas with elevating levels of infection.[42]
</p><p>The vaccine is given by injection.  An initial dose provides protection lasting one year starting 2–4 weeks after vaccination; the second booster dose, given six to 12 months later, provides protection for over 20 years.[42]
</p><p>The vaccine was introduced in 1992 and was initially recommended for persons at high risk. Since then, Bahrain and Israel have embarked on elimination programmes.[43] Australia, China, Belarus, Italy, Spain, and the United States have started similar programmes. The incidence of hepatitis A where widespread vaccination has been practised has decreased dramatically. In China and the United States, the incidence of hepatitis A has decreased by 90% since 1990.[44][45]
</p><p>In the United States, vaccination of children is recommended at 1 and 2 years of age;[1] hepatitis A vaccination is not recommended in those younger than 12 months of age.[46] It is also recommended in those who have not been previously immunized and who have been exposed or are likely to be exposed due to travel.[1] The CDC recommends vaccination against infection for men who have sex with men.[47]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>No specific treatment for hepatitis A is known. Recovery from symptoms following infection may take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhea.[13]
</p>"
20,Hepatitis B,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Vaccine[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Hepatitis B vaccine</div><p>Vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B have been routinely recommended for babies since 1991 in the United States.[64] The first dose is generally recommended within a day of birth.[65]
</p><p>Most vaccines are given in three doses over a course of months. A protective response to the vaccine is defined as an anti-HBs antibody concentration of  at least 10 mIU/ml in the recipient's serum. The vaccine is more effective in children and 95 percent of those vaccinated have protective levels of antibody. This drops to around 90% at 40 years of age  and to around 75 percent in those over 60 years. The protection afforded by vaccination is long lasting even after antibody levels fall below 10 mIU/ml. For newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers: hepatitis B vaccine alone, hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone, or the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin, all prevent hepatitis B occurrence.[66] Furthermore, the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin is superior to vaccine alone.[66] This combination prevents HBV transmission around the time of birth in 86% to 99% of cases.[67]
</p><p>Tenofovir given in the second or third trimester can reduce the risk of mother to child transmission by 77% when combined with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and the hepatitis B vaccine, especially for pregnant women with high hepatitis B virus DNA levels.[68] However, there is no sufficient evidence that the administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone during pregnancy, might reduce transmission rates to the newborn infant.[69]  No randomized control trial has been conducted to assess the effects of hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy for preventing infant infection.[70]
</p><p>All those with a risk of exposure to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already.[64] Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses of vaccine are given to those who are not sufficiently immunized.[64]
</p><p>In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among those with a normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections have been documented.[71] Vaccination is particularly recommended for high risk groups including: health workers, people with chronic renal failure, and men who have sex with men.[72][73][74]
</p><p>Both types of the hepatitis B vaccine, the plasma-derived vaccine (PDV) and recombinant vaccine (RV) are of similar effectiveness in preventing the infection in both healthcare workers and chronic renal failure groups.[72][73] With one difference noticed among health worker group, that the RV intramuscular route is significantly more effective compared with RV intradermal route of administration.[72]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>In assisted reproductive technology, sperm washing is not necessary for males with hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated.[75] In females with hepatitis B, the risk of transmission from mother to child with IVF is no different from the risk in spontaneous conception.[75]
</p><p>Those at high risk of infection should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease.[76] Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, men who have sex with men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.[76]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Acute hepatitis B infection does not usually require treatment and most adults clear the infection spontaneously.[77][78] Early antiviral treatment may be required in fewer than 1% of people, whose infection takes a very aggressive course (fulminant hepatitis) or who are immunocompromised. On the other hand, treatment of chronic infection may be necessary to reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronically infected individuals with persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver damage, and HBV DNA levels are candidates for therapy.[79] Treatment lasts from six months to a year, depending on medication and genotype.[80] Treatment duration when medication is taken by mouth, however, is more variable and usually longer than one year.[81]
</p><p>Although none of the available medications can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. As of 2018, there are eight medications licensed for the treatment of hepatitis B infection in the United States. These include antiviral medications lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, telbivudine, and entecavir, and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha-2a and PEGylated interferon alpha-2a. In 2015 the World Health Organization recommended tenofovir or entecavir as first-line agents.[82] Those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment.[82]
</p><p>The use of interferon, which requires injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly.[83] However, some individuals are much more likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood).[84] Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.[85]
</p>"
21,Hepatitis C,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div>See also: Hepatitis C vaccine</div><p>As of 2016[update], no approved vaccine protects against contracting hepatitis C.[78] A combination of harm reduction strategies, such as the provision of new needles and syringes and treatment of substance use, decreases the risk of hepatitis C in intravenous drug users by about 75%.[79] The screening of blood donors is important at a national level, as is adhering to universal precautions within healthcare facilities.[20] In countries where there is an insufficient supply of sterile syringes, medications should be given orally rather than via injection (when possible).[25]
</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>HCV induces chronic infection in 80% of infected persons.[1] Approximately 95% of these clear with treatment.[4] In rare cases, infection can clear without treatment.[17] Those with chronic hepatitis C are advised to avoid alcohol and medications toxic to the liver.[15] They should also be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B due to the increased risk if also infected.[15] Use of acetaminophen is generally considered safe at reduced doses.[10] Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended in those with advanced liver disease due to an increased risk of bleeding.[10] Ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma is recommended in those with accompanying cirrhosis.[15] Coffee consumption has been associated with a slower rate of liver scarring in those infected with HCV.[10]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>Treatment with antiviral medication is recommended in all people with proven chronic hepatitis C who are not at high risk of dying from other causes.[80] People with the highest complication risk should be treated first, with the risk of complications based on the degree of liver scarring.[80] The initial recommended treatment depends on the type of hepatitis C virus, if the person has received previous hepatitis C treatment, and whether or not a person has cirrhosis.[81] Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) may reduce the number of the infected people.[82]
</p><h4>No prior treatment</h4><ul>HCV genotype 1a (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (the latter for people who do not have HIV/AIDS, are not African-American, and have less than 6 million HCV viral copies per milliliter of blood) or 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.[83] Sofosbuvir with either daclatasvir or simeprevir may also be used.[81]
HCV genotype 1a (with compensated cirrhosis): 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. An alternative treatment regimen of elbasvir/grazoprevir with weight-based ribavirin for 16 weeks can be used if the HCV is found to have antiviral resistance mutations against NS5A protease inhibitors.[84]
HCV genotype 1b (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (with the aforementioned limitations for the latter as above) or 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Alternative regimens include 12 weeks of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir with either daclatasvir or simeprevir.[85]
HCV genotype 1b (with compensated cirrhosis): 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. A 12-week course of paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir with dasabuvir may also be used.[86]
HCV genotype 2 (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Alternatively, 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir can be used.[87]
HCV genotype 2 (with compensated cirrhosis): 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. An alternative regimen of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir can be used for 16–24 weeks.[88]
HCV genotype 3 (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.[89]
HCV genotype 3 (with compensated cirrhosis): 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, or if certain antiviral mutations are present, 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (when certain antiviral mutations are present), or 24 weeks of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.[90]
HCV genotype 4 (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. A 12-week regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is also acceptable in combination with weight-based ribavirin.[91]
HCV genotype 4 (with compensated cirrhosis): A 12-week regimen of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasavir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is recommended. A 12-week course of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir  with weight-based ribavirin is an acceptable alternative.[92]
HCV genotype 5 or 6 (with or without compensated cirrhosis): If no cirrhosis is present, then 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is recommended. If cirrhosis is present, then a 12-week course of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is warranted.[93]</ul><p>Chronic infection can be cured about 95% of the time with recommended treatment in 2017.[1][4] Getting access to these treatments however can be expensive.[4] The combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir may be used in those who have previously been treated with sofosbuvir or other drugs that inhibit NS5A and were not cured.[94]
</p><p>Prior to 2011, treatments consisted of a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin for a period of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype.[15] This produces cure rates of between 70 and 80% for genotype 2 and 3, respectively, and 45 to 70% for genotypes 1 and 4.[95] Adverse effects with these treatments were common, with half of people getting flu-like symptoms and a third experiencing emotional problems.[15] Treatment during the first six months is more effective than once hepatitis C has become chronic.[28] In those with chronic hepatitis B, treatment for hepatitis C results in reactivation of hepatitis B in about 25%.[96]
</p><h3>Surgery</h3><p>Cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is a common reason for liver transplantation[28] though the virus usually (80–90% of cases) recurs afterwards.[5][97] Infection of the graft leads to 10–30% of people developing cirrhosis within five years.[98] Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin post-transplant decreases the risk of recurrence to 70%.[99] A 2013 review found unclear evidence regarding if antiviral medication was useful if the graft became reinfetcted.[100]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>Several alternative therapies are claimed by their proponents to be helpful for hepatitis C including milk thistle, ginseng, and colloidal silver.[101] However, no alternative therapy has been shown to improve outcomes in hepatitis C, and no evidence exists that alternative therapies have any effect on the virus at all.[101][102][103]
</p><h2>Research</h2><p>As of 2011[update], there are about one hundred medications in development for hepatitis C.[128] These include vaccines to treat hepatitis, immunomodulators, and cyclophilin inhibitors, among others.[142] These potential new treatments have come about due to a better understanding of the hepatitis C virus.[143] There are a number of vaccines under development and some have shown encouraging results.[78]
</p><p>The combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in one trial (reported in 2015) resulted in cure rates of 99%.[144] More studies are needed to investigate the role of the preventative antiviral medication against HCV recurrence after transplantation.[145]
</p><h3>Animal models</h3><p>One barrier to finding treatments for hepatitis C is the lack of a suitable animal model. Despite moderate success, current research highlights the need for pre-clinical testing in mammalian systems such as mouse, particularly for the development of vaccines in poorer communities. Currently, chimpanzees remain the available living system to study, yet their use has ethical concerns and regulatory restrictions. While scientists have made use of human cell culture systems such as hepatocytes, questions have been raised about their accuracy in reflecting the body's response to infection.[146]
</p><p>One aspect of hepatitis research is to reproduce infections in mammalian models. A strategy is to introduce liver tissues from humans into mice, a technique known as xenotransplantation. This is done by generating chimeric mice, and exposing the mice HCV infection. This engineering process is known to create humanized mice, and provide opportunities to study hepatitis C within the 3D architectural design of the liver and evaluating antiviral compounds.[146] Alternatively, generating inbred mice with susceptibility to HCV would simplify the process of studying mouse models.

22,Hepatitis D,"<h2>Prevention and Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The vaccine for hepatitis B protects against hepatitis D virus because of the latter's dependence on the presence of hepatitis B virus for it to replicate.[28][29]
</p><p>Hepatitis D is generally considered the dominant virus over hepatitis B except in rare instances. Current established treatments for chronic hepatitis D include conventional or pegylated interferon alpha therapy. [30] Latest evidence suggests that pegylated interferon alpha is effective in reducing the viral load and the effect of the disease during the time the drug is given, but the benefit generally stops if the drug is discontinued.[31] The efficiency of this treatment does not usually exceed ~20%, and late relapse after therapy has been reported.[32][33]
</p><h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>In absence of a specific vaccine against delta virus, the vaccine against HBV must be given soon after birth in risk groups.
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment is similar to hepatitis B, but due to its high lethality, more aggressive therapeutic approaches are recommended in the acute phase.
</p><p>
</p>"
23,Hepatitis E,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Sanitation[edit]</h3><p>Sanitation is the most important measure in prevention of hepatitis E; this consists of proper treatment and disposal of human waste, higher standards for public water supplies, improved personal hygiene procedures, and sanitary food preparation. Thus, prevention strategies of this disease are similar to those of many others that plague developing nations.[27]
</p><h3>Vaccines[edit]</h3><p>A vaccine based on recombinant viral proteins was developed in the 1990s and tested in a high-risk population (in Nepal) in 2001.[47] The vaccine appeared to be effective and safe, but development was stopped for lack of profitability, since hepatitis E is rare in developed countries.[48] No hepatitis E vaccine is licensed for use in the United States.[49]
</p><p>Although other HEV vaccine trials have been successful, these vaccines have not yet been produced or made available to susceptible populations. The exception is China; after more than a year of scrutiny and inspection by China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), a hepatitis E vaccine developed by Chinese scientists was available at the end of 2012. The vaccine—called HEV 239 by its developer Xiamen Innovax Biotech—was approved for prevention of hepatitis E in 2012 by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, following a controlled trial on 100,000+ people from Jiangsu Province where none of those vaccinated became infected during a 12-month period, compared to 15 in the group given placebo.[50] The first vaccine batches came out of Innovax' factory in late October 2012, to be sold to Chinese distributors.[48]
</p><p>Due to the lack of evidence, WHO as of 2015[update] did not make a recommendation regarding routine use of the HEV 239 vaccine.[51] National authorities may however, decide to use the vaccine based on the local epidemiology.[51]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><div> Ribavirin</div><p>In terms of treatment, ribavirin is not registered for hepatitis E treatment, though  off-label experience for treating chronic hepatitis E with this compound exists. The use of low doses of ribavirin over a three-month period has been associated with viral clearance in about two-thirds of chronic cases. Other possible treatments include pegylated interferon or a combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon. In general, chronic HEV infection is associated with immunosuppressive therapies, but remarkably little is known about how different immunosuppressants affect HEV infection. In individuals with solid-organ transplantation, viral clearance can be achieved by temporal reduction of the level of immunosuppression.[52][53]
</p>"
24,Alcoholic hepatitis,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Clinical practice guidelines have recommended corticosteroids.[4] People should be risk stratified using a MELD Score or Child-Pugh score.
</p><ul>Corticosteroids: These guidelines suggest that patients with a modified Maddrey's discriminant function score > 32 or hepatic encephalopathy should be considered for treatment with prednisolone 40 mg daily for four weeks followed by a taper.[4]  Models such as the Lille Model can be used to monitor for improvement or to consider alternative treatment.
Pentoxifylline: A randomized controlled trial found that among patients with a discriminant function score > 32 and at least one of the following symptoms (a palpable, tender enlarged liver, fever, high white blood cell count, hepatic encephalopathy, or hepatic systolic bruit), 4.6 patients must be treated with pentoxifylline for 4 weeks to prevent one patient from dying.[5] Subsequent trials have suggested that pentoxifylline may be superior to prednisolone in the management of acute alcoholic hepatitis with discriminant function score >32. Advantage of pentoxifylline over prednisolone was better tolerability, lesser side effects, with decreased occurrence of renal dysfunction in patients receiving pentoxifylline.[6]
Potential for combined therapy: A large prospective study of over 1000 patients investigated whether prednisolone and pentoxifylline produced benefits when used alone or in combination.[7]  Pentoxifylline did not improve survival alone or in combination. Prednisolone gave a small reduction in mortality at 28 days but this did not reach significance, and there were no improvements in outcomes at 90 days or 1 year.</ul>"
25,Tuberculosis,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div> Tuberculosis prevention poster from the United States, c. 1940</div><p>Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[14] The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[14] The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening people who are at high risk for latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.[78]
</p><h3>Vaccines</h3><div>Main articles: Tuberculosis vaccines and BCG vaccine</div><p>The only available vaccine as of 2011 is Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG).[79] In children it decreases the risk of getting the infection by 20% and the risk of infection turning into active disease by nearly 60%.[80]
</p><p>It is the most widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all children being vaccinated.[14] The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years.[14] As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk.[81][82][83] Part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test's usefulness as a screening tool.[83] A number of new vaccines are currently in development.[14]
</p><h3>Public health</h3><p>The World Health Organization declared TB a ""global health emergency"" in 1993,[14] and in 2006, the Stop TB Partnership developed a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis that aimed to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015.[84] A number of targets they set were not achieved by 2015, mostly due to the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis.[14] A tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is used primarily in public health programs.[85]
</p><h2>Management</h2><div>Main article: Tuberculosis management</div><p>Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective.[86]
</p><p>Latent TB is treated with either isoniazid alone, or a combination of isoniazid with either rifampicin or rifapentine.[87][88] The treatment takes at least three months.[51][87][89] People with latent infections are treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life.[90]
</p><p>Active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance.[14]
</p><h3>New onset</h3><p>The recommended treatment of new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, as of 2010, is six months of a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isoniazid for the last four months.[14] Where resistance to isoniazid is high, ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative.[14]
</p><h3>Recurrent disease</h3><p>If tuberculosis recurs, testing to determine which antibiotics it is sensitive to is important before determining treatment.[14] If multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24 months is recommended.[14]
</p><h3>Medication administration</h3><p>Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics.[91] The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality.[92] There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine.[92] Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker.[92] Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.[93]
</p><h3>Medication resistance</h3><p>Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication.[94] Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs.[95] Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs.[96] It was first observed in 2003 in Italy,[97] but not widely reported until 2012,[96][98] and has also been found in Iran and India.[99][100] Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.[101]
</p><p>XDR-TB is a term sometimes used to define extensively resistant TB, and constitutes one in ten cases of MDR-TB. Cases of XDR TB have been identified in more than 90% of countries.[99]
</p><h2>Research</h2><p>The BCG vaccine has limitations, and research to develop new TB vaccines is ongoing.[167] A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials.[167][168] Two main approaches are being used to attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines.[167] MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, currently in trials in South Africa, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus.[169] Vaccines are hoped to play a significant role in treatment of both latent and active disease.[170]
</p><p>To encourage further discovery, researchers and policymakers are promoting new economic models of vaccine development, including prizes, tax incentives, and advance market commitments.[171][172] A number of groups, including the Stop TB Partnership,[173] the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation, are involved with research.[174] Among these, the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation received a gift of more than $280 million (US) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and license an improved vaccine against tuberculosis for use in high burden countries.[175][176]
</p><p>A number of medications are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid.[177] Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012.[178] The safety and effectiveness of these new agents are still uncertain, because they are based on the results of relatively small studies.[177][179] However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug,[180] which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.[179][181]
</p>"
26,Common Cold,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>The only useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical measures[14] such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used.[14] Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly.[14] Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.[56]
</p><p>Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children.[57] Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown.[57] Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.[57]
</p><p>It is unclear if zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold.[58] Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though they may reduce its duration.[59] Gargling with water was found useful in one small trial.[60]
</p><h2>Management</h2><div> Poster from 1937 encouraging citizens to ""consult your physician"" for treatment of the common cold</div><p>Treatment for the common cold primarily involves medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief.[10] Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, and gargling with warm salt water are reasonable conservative measures.[34] Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect.[61] No medications or herbal remedies have been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection.[62]
</p><h3>Symptomatic</h3><p>Treatments that may help with symptoms include simple pain medication and medications for fevers such as ibuprofen[9] and acetaminophen (paracetamol).[63] It, however, is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms.[64]  It is not known if over the counter cough medications are effective for treating an acute cough.[65] Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children due to a lack of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm.[66][67] In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits.[66] The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries.[68] Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful.[69]
</p><p>In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit.[70] Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness.[71] Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults.[72][70] Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness.[73] The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.[70]
</p><p>Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness.[74] As of 2017 heated and humidified air, such as via RhinoTherm, is of unclear benefit.[75] One study has found chest vapor rub to provide some relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.[76]
</p><p>Some advise to avoid physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue.[77][78] It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat.[77][78] There is an old wives tale that having a hot drink can help with cold symptoms, but evidence to support this is very limited.[79]
</p><h3>Antibiotics and antivirals</h3><p>Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold.[80] Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed.[80][81] Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics.[82] There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.[10][83]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>While there are many alternative treatments used for the common cold, there is insufficient scientific evidence to support the use of most.[10] As of 2018 there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against honey.[84] As of 2015, there is tentative evidence to support nasal irrigation.[85]
</p><p>Zinc supplements may shorten the duration and reduce the severity of symptoms if supplementation begins within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.[8][58][86][87] Some zinc remedies directly applied to the inside of the nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell.[88] A 2017 expert panel, however, found the evidence to be insufficient to recommend zinc's use.[16]
</p><p>Vitamin C's effect on the common cold, while extensively researched, is disappointing, except in limited circumstances: specifically, individuals exercising vigorously in cold environments.[59][89] There is no firm evidence that Echinacea products provide any meaningful benefit in treating or preventing colds.[90] It is unknown if garlic is effective.[91] A single trial of vitamin D did not find benefit.[92]
</p><h2>Research directions</h2><p>Antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; as of 2009, none had been both found effective and licensed for use.[83] There are ongoing trials of the anti-viral drug pleconaril which shows promise against picornaviruses as well as trials of BTA-798.[104] The oral form of pleconaril had  safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied.[104] DRACO, a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy, has shown preliminary effectiveness in treating rhinovirus, as well as other infectious viruses.[105]
</p><p>The genomes for all known human rhinovirus strains have been sequenced.[106]
</p><div></div>"
27,Pneumonia,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[20] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[22]
</p><h3>Vaccination</h3><p>Vaccination prevents against certain bacterial and viral pneumonias both in children and adults. Influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza,[11][71][needs update] The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older.[72] Immunizing health care workers decreases the risk of viral pneumonia among their people.[65]
</p><p>Vaccinations against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have good evidence to support their use.[46] There is strong evidence for vaccinating children under the age of 2 against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine).[73][74][75] Vaccinating children against Streptococcus pneumoniae has led to a decreased rate of these infections in adults, because many adults acquire infections from children. A Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine is available for adults, and has been found to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease by 74%, but there is insufficient evidence to suggest using the pneumococcal vaccine to prevent pneumonia or death in the general adult population.[76] The CDC recommends that young children and adults over the age of 65 receive the pneumococcal vaccine, as well as older children or younger adults who have an increased risk of getting pneumococcal disease.[75] The pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of community acquired pneumonia in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but does not reduce mortality or the risk of hospitalization for people with this condition.[77] People with COPD are suggested to have a pneumococcal vaccination.[77] Other vaccines for which there is support for a protective effect against pneumonia include pertussis, varicella, and measles.[78]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>When influenza outbreaks occur, medications such as amantadine or rimantadine may help prevent the condition; however are associated with side effects.[79] Zanamivir or oseltamivir decrease the chance that people who are exposed to the virus will develop symptoms; however, it is recommended that potential side effects are taken into account.[80]
</p><h3>Other</h3><p>Smoking cessation[57] and reducing indoor air pollution, such as that from cooking indoors with wood or dung, are both recommended.[20][22] Smoking appears to be the single biggest risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia in otherwise-healthy adults.[65] Hand hygiene and coughing into one's sleeve may also be effective preventative measures.[78] Wearing surgical masks by the sick may also prevent illness.[65]
</p><p>Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia.[22][78][81] In children less than 6 months of age, exclusive breast feeding reduces both the risk and severity of disease.[22] In those with HIV/AIDS and a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/uL the antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole decreases the risk of Pneumocystis pneumonia[82] and is also useful for prevention in those that are immunocomprised but do not have HIV.[83]
</p><p>Testing pregnant women for Group B Streptococcus and Chlamydia trachomatis, and administering antibiotic treatment, if needed, reduces rates of pneumonia in infants;[84][85] preventive measures for HIV transmission from mother to child may also be efficient.[86] Suctioning the mouth and throat of infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid has not been found to reduce the rate of aspiration pneumonia and may cause potential harm,[87] thus this practice is not recommended in the majority of situations.[87] In the frail elderly good oral health care may lower the risk of aspiration pneumonia.[88] Zinc supplementation in children 2 months to five years old appears to reduce rates of pneumonia.[89]
</p><p>For people with low levels of vitamin C in their diet or blood, taking vitamin C supplements may be suggested to decrease the risk of pneumonia, although there is no strong evidence of benefit.[90] There is insufficient evidence to recommend that the general population take vitamin C to prevent pneumonia.[90]
</p><p>For adults and children in the hospital who require a respirator, there is no strong evidence indicating a difference between heat and moisture exchangers and heated humidifiers for preventing pneumonia.[91] There is no good evidence that one approach to mouth care is better than others in preventing nursing home acquired pneumonia.[92]

</table><p>Antibiotics by mouth, rest, simple analgesics, and fluids usually suffice for complete resolution.[57] However, those with other medical conditions, the elderly, or those with significant trouble breathing may require more advanced care. If the symptoms worsen, the pneumonia does not improve with home treatment, or complications occur, hospitalization may be required.[57] Worldwide, approximately 7–13% of cases in children result in hospitalization,[20] whereas in the developed world between 22 and 42% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia are admitted.[57] The CURB-65 score is useful for determining the need for admission in adults.[57] If the score is 0 or 1, people can typically be managed at home; if it is 2, a short hospital stay or close follow-up is needed; if it is 3–5, hospitalization is recommended.[57] In children those with respiratory distress or oxygen saturations of less than 90% should be hospitalized.[93] The utility of chest physiotherapy in pneumonia has not yet been determined.[94][needs update][95] Non-invasive ventilation may be beneficial in those admitted to the intensive care unit.[96] Over-the-counter cough medicine has not been found to be effective,[97] nor has the use of zinc in children.[98] There is insufficient evidence for mucolytics.[97] There is no strong evidence to recommend that children who have non-measles related pneumonia take Vitamin A supplements.[99] For those with sepsis, 30 ml/kg of crystalloid should be infused to correct hypotension.[33] Vitamin D, as of 2018 is of unclear benefit in children.[100]
</p><h3>Bacterial</h3><p>Antibiotics improve outcomes in those with bacterial pneumonia.[12] First dose of antibiotics should be given as soon as possible.[33] Increased use of antibiotics, however, may lead to the development of antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria.[101] Antibiotic choice depends initially on the characteristics of the person affected, such as age, underlying health, and the location the infection was acquired. Antibiotic use is also associated with side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, taste distortion, or headaches.[101] In the UK, treatment before culture results with amoxicillin is recommended as the first line for community-acquired pneumonia, with doxycycline or clarithromycin as alternatives.[57] In North America, where the ""atypical"" forms of community-acquired pneumonia are more common, macrolides (such as azithromycin or erythromycin), and doxycycline have displaced amoxicillin as first-line outpatient treatment in adults.[35][102] In children with mild or moderate symptoms, amoxicillin taken by mouth remains the first line.[93][103][104] The use of fluoroquinolones in uncomplicated cases is discouraged due to concerns about side-effects and generating resistance in light of there being no greater clinical benefit.[35][105]
</p><p>For those who require hospitalization and caught their pneumonia in the community the use of a β-lactam such as cephazolin plus macrolide such as azithromycin or a fluoroquinolones is recommended.[106] Antibiotics by mouth and by injection appear to be similarly effective in children with severe pneumonia.[107]
</p><p>The duration of treatment has traditionally been seven to ten days, but increasing evidence suggests that shorter courses (3–5 days) may be effective for certain types of pneumonia and may reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.[108][109][110][111] For pneumonia that is associated with a ventilator caused by non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NF-GNB), a shorter course of antibiotics increases the risk of that pneumonia will return.[110] Recommendations for hospital-acquired pneumonia include third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin.[70] These antibiotics are often given intravenously and used in combination.[70] In those treated in hospital, more than 90% improve with the initial antibiotics.[25] For people with ventilator-acquired pneumonia, the choice of antibiotic therapy will depend on the person's risk of being infected with a strain of bacteria that is multi-drug resistant.[31] Once clinically stable, intravenous antibiotics should be swithced to oral antibiotics.[33] For those with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Legionella infections, prolonged antibiotics may be beneficial.[33]
</p><p>The addition of corticosteroids to standard antibiotic treatment appears to improve outcomes, reducing death and morbidity for adults with severe community acquired pneumonia, and reducing death for adults and children with non-severe community acquired pneumonia.[112][113] Side effects associated with the use of corticosteroids include high blood sugar.[112] They are therefore recommended in adults with severe community acquired pneumonia.[112] There is some evidence that adding corticosteroids to the standard PCP pneumonia treatment may be beneficial for people who are infected with HIV.[40]
</p><p>The use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) along with antibiotics does not appear to reduce mortality and routine use for treating pneumonia is not supported by evidence.[114]
</p><h3>Viral</h3><p>Neuraminidase inhibitors may be used to treat viral pneumonia caused by influenza viruses (influenza A and influenza B).[11] No specific antiviral medications are recommended for other types of community acquired viral pneumonias including SARS coronavirus, adenovirus, hantavirus, and parainfluenza virus.[11] Influenza A may be treated with rimantadine or amantadine, while influenza A or B may be treated with oseltamivir, zanamivir or peramivir.[11] These are of most benefit if they are started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.[11] Many strains of H5N1 influenza A, also known as avian influenza or ""bird flu"", have shown resistance to rimantadine and amantadine.[11] The use of antibiotics in viral pneumonia is recommended by some experts, as it is impossible to rule out a complicating bacterial infection.[11] The British Thoracic Society recommends that antibiotics be withheld in those with mild disease.[11] The use of corticosteroids is controversial.[11]
</p><h3>Aspiration</h3><p>In general, aspiration pneumonitis is treated conservatively with antibiotics indicated only for aspiration pneumonia.[115] The choice of antibiotic will depend on several factors, including the suspected causative organism and whether pneumonia was acquired in the community or developed in a hospital setting. Common options include clindamycin, a combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic and metronidazole, or an aminoglycoside.[116]
Corticosteroids are sometimes used in aspiration pneumonia, but there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness.[115]
</p>"
28,Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>A number of preventative measures are recommended, including avoiding straining while attempting to defecate, avoiding constipation and diarrhea either by eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluid or by taking fiber supplements, and getting sufficient exercise.[5][17] Spending less time attempting to defecate, avoiding reading while on the toilet,[1] and losing weight for overweight persons and avoiding heavy lifting are also recommended.[18]
</p><h2>Management</h2><h3>Conservative</h3><p>Conservative treatment typically consists of foods rich in dietary fiber, intake of oral fluids to maintain hydration, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sitz baths, and rest.[1] Increased fiber intake has been shown to improve outcomes[19] and may be achieved by dietary alterations or the consumption of fiber supplements.[1][19] Evidence for benefits from sitz baths during any point in treatment, however, is lacking.[20] If they are used, they should be limited to 15 minutes at a time.[2]:182 Decreasing time spent on the toilet and not straining is also recommended.[21]
</p><p>While many topical agents and suppositories are available for the treatment of hemorrhoids, little evidence supports their use.[1] Steroid-containing agents should not be used for more than 14 days, as they may cause thinning of the skin.[1] Most agents include a combination of active ingredients.[2] These may include a barrier cream such as petroleum jelly or zinc oxide, an analgesic agent such as lidocaine, and a vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine.[2] Some contain Balsam of Peru to which certain people may be allergic.[22][23]
</p><p>Flavonoids are of questionable benefit, with potential side effects.[2][24] Symptoms usually resolve following pregnancy; thus active treatment is often delayed until after delivery.[25] Evidence does not support the use of traditional Chinese herbal treatment.[26]
</p><h3>Procedures</h3><div> Rubber band ligation.</div><p>A number of office-based procedures may be performed. While generally safe, rare serious side effects such as perianal sepsis may occur.[6]
</p><ul>Rubber band ligation is typically recommended as the first-line treatment in those with grade 1 to 3 disease.[6] It is a procedure in which elastic bands are applied onto an internal hemorrhoid at least 1 cm above the pectinate line to cut off its blood supply. Within 5–7 days, the withered hemorrhoid falls off. If the band is placed too close to the pectinate line, intense pain results immediately afterwards.[1] Cure rate has been found to be about 87%[1] with a complication rate of up to 3%.[6]
Sclerotherapy involves the injection of a sclerosing agent, such as phenol, into the hemorrhoid. This causes the vein walls to collapse and the hemorrhoids to shrivel up. The success rate four years after treatment is about 70%.[1]
A number of cauterization methods have been shown to be effective for hemorrhoids, but are usually only used when other methods fail. This procedure can be done using electrocautery, infrared radiation, laser surgery,[1] or cryosurgery.[27] Infrared cauterization may be an option for grade 1 or 2 disease.[6] In those with grade 3 or 4 disease, reoccurrence rates are high.[6]</ul><h3>Surgery</h3><p>A number of surgical techniques may be used if conservative management and simple procedures fail.[6] All surgical treatments are associated with some degree of complications including bleeding, infection, anal strictures and urinary retention, due to the close proximity of the rectum to the nerves that supply the bladder.[1] Also, a small risk of fecal incontinence occurs, particularly of liquid,[2][28] with rates reported between 0% and 28%.[29] Mucosal ectropion is another condition which may occur after hemorrhoidectomy (often together with anal stenosis).[30] This is where the anal mucosa becomes everted from the anus, similar to a very mild form of rectal prolapse.[30]
</p><ul>Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is a surgical excision of the hemorrhoid used primarily only in severe cases.[1] It is associated with significant postoperative pain and usually requires 2–4 weeks for recovery.[1] However, the long-term benefit is greater in those with grade 3 hemorrhoids as compared to rubber band ligation.[31] It is the recommended treatment in those with a thrombosed external hemorrhoid if carried out within 24–72 hours.[6][12] Evidence to support this however is weak.[21] Glyceryl trinitrate ointment after the procedure helps both with pain and healing.[32]
Doppler-guided, transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization is a minimally invasive treatment using an ultrasound doppler to accurately locate the arterial blood inflow. These arteries are then ""tied off"" and the prolapsed tissue is sutured back to its normal position. It has a slightly higher recurrence rate, but fewer complications compared to a hemorrhoidectomy.[1]
Stapled hemorrhoidectomy,  also known as stapled hemorrhoidopexy, involves the removal of much of the abnormally enlarged hemorrhoidal tissue, followed by a repositioning of the remaining hemorrhoidal tissue back to its normal anatomical position. It is generally less painful and is associated with faster healing compared to complete removal of hemorrhoids.[1] However, the chance of symptomatic hemorrhoids returning is greater than for conventional hemorroidectomy,[33] so it is typically only recommended for grade 2 or 3 disease.[6]</ul>"
29,Heart attack,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of acute coronary syndrome</div><p>A myocardial infarction requires immediate medical attention. Treatment aims to preserve as much heart muscle as possible, and to prevent further complications.[25] Treatment depends on whether the myocardial infarction is a STEMI or NSTEMI.[64] Treatment in general aims to unblock blood vessels, reduce blot clot enlargement, reduce ischemia, and modify risk factors with the aim of preventing future MIs.[25] In addition, the main treatment for myocardial infarctions with ECG evidence of ST elevation (STEMI) include thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention, although PCI is also ideally conducted within 1–3 days for NSTEMI.[64] In addition to clinical judgement, risk stratification may be used to guide treatment, such as with the TIMI and GRACE scoring systems.[16][64][87]
</p><h3>Pain[edit]</h3><p>The pain associated with myocardial infarction may be treated with nitroglycerin or morphine.[25] Nitroglycerin (given under the tongue or intravenously) may improve the blood supply to the heart, and decrease the work the heart must do.[25] It is an important part of therapy for its pain relief, despite there being no benefit to overall mortality.[25][88] Morphine may also be used, and is effective for the pain associated with STEMI.[25] The evidence for benefit from morphine on overall outcomes, however, is poor and there is some evidence of potential harm.[89][90]
</p><h3>Anticoagulation[edit]</h3><p>Aspirin, an antiplatelet anticoagulant, is given as a loading dose with the goal of reducing the clot size and reduce further clotting in the affected artery.[25][64] It is known to decrease mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction by at least 50%.[64] P2Y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor are given concurrently, also as a loading dose, with the dose depending on whether further surgical management or fibrinolysis is planned.[64] Prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended in European and American guidelines, as they are active more quickly and consistently than clopidogrel.[64] P2Y12 inhibitors are recommended in both NSTEMI and STEMI, including in PCI, with evidence also to suggest improved mortality.[64] Heparins, particularly in the unfractionated form, act at several points in the clotting cascade, help to prevent the enlargement of a clot, and are also given in myocardial infarction, owing to evidence suggesting improved mortality rates.[64] In very high-risk scenarios, inhibitors of the platelet glycoprotein αIIbβ3a receptor such as eptifibatide or tirofiban may be used.[64]
</p><p>There is varying evidence on the mortality benefits in NSTEMI. A 2014 review of P2Y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel found they do not change the risk of death when given to people with a suspected NSTEMI prior to PCI,[91] nor do heparins change the risk of death.[92] They do decrease the risk of having a further myocardial infarction.[64][92]
</p><h3>Angiogram[edit]</h3><p>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the treatment of choice for STEMI if it can be performed in a timely manner, ideally within 90–120 minutes of contact with a medical provider.[64][93] Some recommend it is also done in NSTEMI within 1–3 days, particularly when considered high-risk.[64] A 2017 review, however, did not find a difference between early versus later PCI in NSTEMI.[94]
</p><p>PCI involves small probes, inserted through peripheral blood vessels such as the femoral artery or radial artery into the blood vessels of the heart. The probes are then used to identify and clear blockages using small balloons, which are dragged through the blocked segment, dragging away the clot, or the insertion of stents.[25][64] Coronary artery bypass grafting is only considered when the affected area of heart muscle large, and PCI is unsuitable, for example with difficult cardiac anatomy.[95] After PCI, people are generally placed on aspirin indefinitely and on dual antiplatelet therapy (generally aspirin and clopidogrel) for at least a year.[19][64][96]
</p><h3>Fibrinolysis[edit]</h3><p>If PCI cannot be performed within 90 to 120 minutes in STEMI then fibrinolysis, preferably within 30 minutes of arrival to hospital, is recommended.[64][97] If a person has had symptoms for 12 to 24 hours evidence for effectiveness of thrombolysis is less and if they have had symptoms for more than 24 hours it is not recommended.[98] Thrombolysis involves the administration of medication that activates the enzymes that normally dissolve blood clots. These medications include tissue plasminogen activator, reteplase, streptokinase, and tenecteplase.[25] Thrombolysis is not recommended in a number of situations, particularly when associated with a high risk of bleeding or the potential for problematic bleeding, such as active bleeding, past strokes or bleeds into the brain, or severe hypertension. Situations in which thrombolysis may be considered, but with caution, include recent surgery, use of anticoagulants, pregnancy, and proclivity to bleeding.[25] Major risks of thrombolysis are major bleeding and intracranial bleeding.[25] Pre-hospital thrombolysis reduces time to thrombolytic treatment, based on studies conducted in higher income countries, however it is unclear whether this has an impact on mortality rates.[99]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>In the past, high flow oxygen was recommended for everyone with a possible myocardial infarction.[75] More recently, no evidence was found for routine use in those with normal oxygen levels and there is potential harm from the intervention.[100][101][102][103] Therefore, oxygen is currently only recommended if oxygen levels are found to be low or if someone is in respiratory distress.[25][75]
</p><p>If despite thrombolysis there is significant cardiogenic shock, continued severe chest pain, or less than a 50% improvement in ST elevation on the ECG recording after 90 minutes, then rescue PCI is indicated emergently.[104][105]
</p><p>Those who have had cardiac arrest may benefit from targeted temperature management with evaluation for implementation of hypothermia protocols. Furthermore, those with cardiac arrest, and ST elevation at any time, should usually have angiography.[19] Aldosterone antagonists appear to be useful in people who have had an STEMI and do not have heart failure.[106]
</p><h3>Rehabilitation[edit]</h3><p>Cardiac rehabilitation benefits many who have experienced myocardial infarction,[64] even if there has been substantial heart damage and resultant left ventricular failure. It should start soon after discharge from the hospital. The program may include lifestyle advice, exercise, social support, as well as recommendations about driving, flying, sport participation, stress management, and sexual intercourse.[107]
</p><h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>There is a large crossover between the lifestyle and activity recommendations to prevent a myocardial infarction, and those that may be adopted as secondary prevention after an initial myocardial infarction,[64] because of shared risk factors and an aim to reduce atherosclerosis affecting heart vessels.[25]
</p><h3>Primary prevention[edit]</h3><h4>Lifestyle[edit]</h4><p>Physical activity can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and people at risk are advised to engage in 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise a week.[108] Keeping a healthy weight, drinking alcohol within the recommended limits, and quitting smoking reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.[108]
</p><p>Substituting polyunsaturated fats such as olive oil and rapeseed oil instead of saturated fats may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction,[41] although there is not universal agreement.[42] Dietary modifications are recommended by some national authorities, with recommendations including increasing the intake of wholegrain starch, reducing sugar intake (particularly of refined sugar), consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, consuming two or more portions of fish per week, and consuming 4–5 portions of unsalted nuts, seeds, or legumes per week.[108] The dietary pattern with the greatest support is the Mediterranean diet.[109] Vitamins and mineral supplements are of no proven benefit,[110] and neither are plant stanols or sterols.[108]
</p><p>Public health measures may also act at a population level to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, for example by reduce unhealthy diets (excessive salt, saturated fat and trans fat) including food labeling and marketing requirements as well as requirements for catering and restaurants, and stimulating physical activity. This may be part of regional cardiovascular disease prevention programs, or through the health impact assessment of regional and local plans and policies.[111]
</p><p>Most guidelines recommend combining different preventive strategies. A 2015 Cochrane Review found some evidence that such an approach might help with blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference. However, there was insufficient evidence to show an effect on mortality or actual cardio-vascular events.[112]
</p><h4>Medication[edit]</h4><p>Statins, drugs that act to lower blood cholesterol, decrease the incidence and mortality rates of myocardial infarctions.[113] They are often recommended in those at an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases.[108]
</p><p>Aspirin has been studied extensively in people considered at increased risk of myocardial infarction. Based on numerous studies in different groups (e.g. people with or without diabetes), there does not appear to be a benefit strong enough to outweigh the risk of excessive bleeding.[114][115] Nevertheless, many clinical practice guidelines continue to recommend aspirin for primary prevention,[116] and some researchers feel that those with very high cardiovascular risk but low risk of bleeding should continue to receive aspirin.[117]
</p><h3>Secondary prevention[edit]</h3><p>There is a large crossover between the lifestyle and activity recommendations to prevent a myocardial infarction, and those that may be adopted as secondary prevention after an initial myocardial infarct.[64] Recommendations include stopping smoking, a gradual return to exercise, eating a healthy diet, low in saturated fat and low in cholesterol, and drinking alcohol within recommended limits, exercising, and trying to achieve a healthy weight.[64][107] Exercise is both safe and effective even if people have had stents or heart failure,[118] and is recommended to start gradually after 1–2 weeks.[64] Counselling should be provided relating to medications used, and for warning signs of depression.[64] Previous studies suggested a benefit from omega-3 fatty acid supplementation but this has not been confirmed.[107]
</p><h4>Medications[edit]</h4><p>Following a heart attack, nitrates, when taken for two days, and ACE-inhibitors decrease the risk of death.[119] Other medications include:
</p><p>Aspirin is continued indefinitely, as well as another antiplatelet agent such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor (""dual antiplatelet therapy"" or DAPT) for up to twelve months.[107] If someone has another medical condition that requires anticoagulation (e.g. with warfarin) this may need to be adjusted based on risk of further cardiac events as well as bleeding risk.[107] In those who have had a stent, more than 12 months of clopidogrel plus aspirin does not affect the risk of death.[120]
</p><p>Beta blocker therapy such as metoprolol or carvedilol is recommended to be started within 24 hours, provided there is no acute heart failure or heart block.[19][75] The dose should be increased to the highest tolerated.[107] Contrary to what was long believed, the use of beta blockers does not appear to affect the risk of death, possibly because other treatments for MI have improved.[121] When beta blocker medication is given within the first 24–72 hours of a STEMI no lives are saved. However, 1 in 200 people were prevented from a repeat heart attack, and another 1 in 200 from having an abnormal heart rhythm. Additionally, for 1 in 91 the medication causes a temporary decrease in the heart's ability to pump blood.[122]
</p><p>ACE inhibitor therapy should be started within 24 hours, and continued indefinitely at the highest tolerated dose. This is provided there is no evidence of worsening kidney failure, high potassium, low blood pressure, or known narrowing of the renal arteries.[64] Those who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors may be treated with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.[107]
</p><p>Statin therapy has been shown to reduce mortality and subsequent cardiac events, and should be commenced with the aim of lowering LDL cholesterol. Other medications, such as ezetimibe, may also be added with this goal in mind.[64]
</p><p>Aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) may be used if there is evidence of left ventricular dysfunction after an MI, ideally after beginning treatment with an ACE inhibitor.[107][123]
</p><h4>Other[edit]</h4><p>A defibrillator, an electric device connected to the heart and surgically inserted under the skin, may be recommended. This is particularly if there are any ongoing signs of heart failure, with a low left ventricular ejection fraction and a New York Heart Association grade II or III after 40 days of the infarction.[64] Defibrillators detect potentially fatal arrhythmia and deliver an electrical shock to the person to depolarize a critical mass of the heart muscle.[124]

30,Varicose veins,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment can be either conservative or active.
</p><h3>Active[edit]</h3><p>Active treatments can be divided into surgical and non-surgical treatments. Newer methods including endovenous laser treatment, radiofrequency ablation and foam sclerotherapy appear to work as well as surgery for varices of the greater saphenous vein.[25]
</p><h3>Conservative[edit]</h3><p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) produced clinical guidelines in July 2013 recommending that all people with symptomatic varicose veins (C2S) and worse should be referred to a vascular service for treatment.[26] Conservative treatments such as support stockings should not be used unless treatment was not possible.
</p><p>The symptoms of varicose veins can be controlled to an extent with the following:
</p><ul>Elevating the legs often provides temporary symptomatic relief.
Advice about regular exercise sounds sensible but is not supported by any evidence.[27]
The wearing of graduated compression stockings with variable pressure gradients (Class II or III) has been shown to correct the swelling, nutritional exchange, and improve the microcirculation in legs affected by varicose veins.[28] They also often provide relief from the discomfort associated with this disease. Caution should be exercised in their use in patients with concurrent peripheral arterial disease.
The wearing of intermittent pneumatic compression devices have been shown to reduce swelling and increase circulation[medical citation needed]
Diosmin/hesperidin and other flavonoids.
Anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or aspirin can be used as part of treatment for superficial thrombophlebitis along with graduated compression hosiery – but there is a risk of intestinal bleeding. In extensive superficial thrombophlebitis, consideration should be given to anti-coagulation, thrombectomy, or sclerotherapy of the involved vein.[medical citation needed]
Topical gel application[vague] helps in managing symptoms related to varicose veins such as inflammation, pain, swelling, itching, and dryness.</ul><h3>Procedures[edit]</h3><h4>Stripping[edit]</h4><p>Stripping consists of removal of all or part the saphenous vein (great/long or lesser/short) main trunk. The complications include deep vein thrombosis (5.3%),[29] pulmonary embolism (0.06%), and wound complications including infection (2.2%). There is evidence for the great saphenous vein regrowing after stripping.[30] For traditional surgery, reported recurrence rates, which have been tracked for 10 years, range from 5–60%. In addition, since stripping removes the saphenous main trunks, they are no longer available for use as venous bypass grafts in the future (coronary or leg artery vital disease).[31]
</p><h4>Other[edit]</h4><p>Other surgical treatments are:
</p><ul>CHIVA method is the ambulatory conservative haemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency. As of 2015 there is tentative evidence of benefits with a relatively low risk of side effects compared to vein stripping.[32]
Ambulatory phlebectomy
Vein ligation is done at the saphenofemoral junction after ligating the tributaries at the sephanofemoral junction without stripping the long saphenous vein provided the perforater veins are competent and absent DVT in the deep veins. With this method, the long saphenous vein is preserved.
Cryosurgery- A cryoprobe is passed down the long saphenous vein following saphenofemoral ligation. Then the probe is cooled with NO2 or CO2 to −85o F. The vein freezes to the probe and can be retrogradely stripped after 5 seconds of freezing. It is a variant of Stripping. The only point of this technique is to avoid a distal incision to remove the stripper.[33]</ul><h4>Sclerotherapy[edit]</h4><p>A commonly performed non-surgical treatment for varicose and ""spider"" leg veins is sclerotherapy, in which medicine (sclerosant) is injected into the veins to make them shrink. The medicines that are commonly used as sclerosants are polidocanol (POL branded Asclera in the United States, Aethoxysklerol in Australia), sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS), Sclerodex (Canada), Hypertonic Saline, Glycerin and Chromated Glycerin. STS (branded Fibrovein in Australia) liquids can be mixed at varying concentrations of sclerosant and varying sclerosant/gas proportions, with air or CO2 or O2 to create foams. Foams may allow more veins to be treated per session with comparable efficacy. Their use in contrast to liquid sclerosant is still somewhat controversial. Sclerotherapy has been used in the treatment of varicose veins for over 150 years.[10] Sclerotherapy is often used for telangiectasias (spider veins) and varicose veins that persist or recur after vein stripping.[34][35] Sclerotherapy can also be performed using foamed sclerosants under ultrasound guidance to treat larger varicose veins, including the great saphenous and small saphenous veins.[36][37]
</p><p>A 1996 study reported a 76% success rate at 24 months in treating saphenofemoral junction and great saphenous vein incompetence with STS 3% solution.[38] A Cochrane Collaboration review[35] concluded sclerotherapy was better than surgery in the short term (1 year) for its treatment success, complication rate and cost, but surgery was better after 5 years, although the research is weak.[39] A Health Technology Assessment found that sclerotherapy provided less benefit than surgery, but is likely to provide a small benefit in varicose veins without reflux.[40] This Health Technology Assessment monograph included reviews of epidemiology, assessment, and treatment, as well as a study on clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery and sclerotherapy.
</p><p>Complications of sclerotherapy are rare but can include blood clots and ulceration. Anaphylactic reactions are ""extraordinarily rare but can be life-threatening,"" and doctors should have resuscitation equipment ready.[41][42] There has been one reported case of stroke after ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy when an unusually large dose of sclerosant foam was injected.
</p><h4> Endovenous thermal ablation[edit]</h4><p>There are three kinds of endovenous thermal ablation treatment possible: laser, radiofrequency, and steam.[43]
</p><p>The Australian Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) in 2008 determined that endovenous laser treatment/ablation (ELA) for varicose veins ""appears to be more effective in the short term, and at least as effective overall, as the comparative procedure of junction ligation and vein stripping for the treatment of varicose veins.""[44] It also found in its assessment of available literature, that ""occurrence rates of more severe complications such as DVT, nerve injury, and paraesthesia, post-operative infections, and haematomas, appears to be greater after ligation and stripping than after EVLT"". Complications for ELA include minor skin burns (0.4%)[45] and temporary paresthesia (2.1%). The longest study of endovenous laser ablation is 39 months.
</p><p>Two prospective randomized trials found speedier recovery and fewer complications after radiofrequency ablation (ERA) compared to open surgery.[46][47] Myers[48] wrote that open surgery for small saphenous vein reflux is obsolete. Myers said these veins should be treated with endovenous techniques, citing high recurrence rates after surgical management, and risk of nerve damage up to 15%. By comparison ERA has been shown to control 80% of cases of small saphenous vein reflux at 4 years, said Myers. Complications for ERA include burns, paraesthesia, clinical phlebitis and slightly higher rates of deep vein thrombosis (0.57%) and pulmonary embolism (0.17%). One 3-year study compared ERA, with a recurrence rate of 33%, to open surgery, which had a recurrence rate of 23%.
</p><p>Steam treatment consists in injection of pulses of steam into the sick vein. This treatment which works with a natural agent (water) has similar results than laser or radiofrequency.[49] The steam presents a lot of post-operative advantages for the patient (good aesthetic results, less pain, etc.)[50]
</p><p>ELA and ERA require specialized training for doctors and special equipment. ELA is performed as an outpatient procedure and does not require an operating theatre, nor does the patient need a general anaesthetic. Doctors use high-frequency ultrasound during the procedure to visualize the anatomical relationships between the saphenous structures. Some practitioners also perform phlebectomy or ultrasound guided sclerotherapy at the time of endovenous treatment. Follow-up treatment to smaller branch varicose veins is often needed in the weeks or months after the initial procedure. Steam is a very promising treatment for both doctors (easy introduction of catheters, efficient on recurrences, ambulatory procedure, easy and economic procedure) and patients (less post-operative pain, a natural agent, fast recovery to daily activities).
</p>"
31,Hypothyroidism,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div> A 3-month-old infant with untreated congenital hypothyroidism showing myxedematous facies, a big tongue, and skin mottling</div><p>Hypothyroidism may be prevented in a population by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI).[40] Encouraged by the World Health Organization,[41] 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread.[40] Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries as a result of attempts to reduce salt intake.[40]
</p><p>Pregnant and breastfeeding women, who require 66% more daily iodine requirement than non-pregnant women, may still not be getting enough iodine.[40][42] The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 250 µg for pregnant and breastfeeding women.[43] As many women will not achieve this from dietary sources alone, the American Thyroid Association recommends a 150 µg daily supplement by mouth.[31][44]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><h3>Hormone replacement[edit]</h3><p>Most people with hypothyroidism symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency are treated with a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine).[7][14] In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications.[7][25] Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.[7]
</p><p>Blood free thyroxine and TSH levels are monitored to help determine whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks after the start of treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms.[7] Normalization of TSH does not mean that other abnormalities associated with hypothyroidism improve entirely, such as elevated cholesterol levels.[49]
</p><p>In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level.[7][9] Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food,[7] as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine.[50] There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.[14]
</p><h4>Liothyronine[edit]</h4><p>Adding liothyronine (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine has been suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but this has not been confirmed by studies.[8][14][51] In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone.[14][52] Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy due to a lack of evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment.[7] Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.[7]
</p><p>People with hypothyroidism who do not feel well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered with regards to the chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine.[53] The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.[53]
</p><h4>Desiccated animal thyroid[edit]</h4><p>Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based thyroid gland extract,[14] most commonly from pigs. It is a combination therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3.[14] It also contains calcitonin (a hormone produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication.[54] This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence;[8][14] British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use.[7][52]
</p><h3>Subclinical hypothyroidism[edit]</h3><p>There is little evidence whether there is a benefit from treating subclinical hypothyroidism, and whether this offsets the risks of overtreatment. Untreated subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary artery disease.[55] A 2007 review found no benefit of thyroid hormone replacement except for ""some parameters of lipid profiles and left ventricular function"".[56] There is no association between subclinical hypothyroidism and an increased risk of bone fractures,[57] nor is there a link with cognitive decline.[58]
</p><p>Since 2008, consensus American and British opinion has been that in general people with TSH under 10 mIU/l do not require treatment.[7][36][59] American guidelines recommend that treatment should be considered in people with symptoms of hypothyroidism, detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, a history of heart disease or are at an increased risk for heart disease, if the TSH is elevated but below 10 mIU/l.[7]
</p><h3>Myxedema coma[edit]</h3><p>Myxedema coma or severe decompensated hypothyroidism usually requires admission to the intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists.[16] For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low to be able to safely swallow medication.[16] While administration through a nasogastric tube is possible, this may be unsafe and is discouraged.[16]
</p><h3>Pregnancy[edit]</h3><p>In women with known hypothyroidism who become pregnant, it is recommended that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5 mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0 mIU/L.[14][31] Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy.[7] The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed,[7][25][31] although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.[60]
</p><p>Women with anti-TPO antibodies who are trying to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past.[7] Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage.[61] The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10 mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended.[7][31] If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended.[31] It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, in the sense that the TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.[60]
</p>"
32,Hyperthyroidism,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><h3>Antithyroid drugs[edit]</h3><p>Thyrostatics (antithyroid drugs) are drugs that inhibit the production of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole (used in the UK) and methimazole (used in the US, Germany and Russia), and propylthiouracil. Thyrostatics are believed to work by inhibiting the iodination of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and, thus, the formation of tetraiodothyronine (T4). Propylthiouracil also works outside the thyroid gland, preventing the conversion of (mostly inactive) T4 to the active form T3. Because thyroid tissue usually contains a substantial reserve of thyroid hormone, thyrostatics can take weeks to become effective and the dose often needs to be carefully titrated over a period of months, with regular doctor visits and blood tests to monitor results.
</p><p>A very high dose is often needed early in treatment, but, if too high a dose is used persistently, patients can develop symptoms of hypothyroidism. This titrating of the dose is difficult to do accurately, and so sometimes a ""block and replace"" attitude is taken. In block and replace treatments thyrostatics are taken in sufficient quantities to completely block thyroid hormones, and the patient treated as though they have complete hypothyroidism.[22]
</p><h3>Beta-blockers[edit]</h3><p>Many of the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as palpitations, trembling, and anxiety are mediated by increases in beta-adrenergic receptors on cell surfaces. Beta blockers, typically used to treat high blood pressure, are a class of drugs that offset this effect, reducing rapid pulse associated with the sensation of palpitations, and decreasing tremor and anxiety. Thus, a patient suffering from hyperthyroidism can often obtain immediate temporary relief until the hyperthyroidism can be characterized with the Radioiodine test noted above and more permanent treatment take place. Note that these drugs do not treat hyperthyroidism or any of its long-term effects if left untreated, but, rather, they treat or reduce only symptoms of the condition.
</p><p>Some minimal effect on thyroid hormone production however also comes with Propranolol - which has two roles in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, determined by the different isomers of propranolol. L-propranolol causes beta-blockade, thus treating the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism such as tremor, palpitations, anxiety, and heat intolerance. D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thereby blocking the conversion of T4 to T3, providing some though minimal therapeutic effect. Other beta-blockers are used to treat only the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism.[23] Propranolol in the UK, and metoprolol in the US, are most frequently used to augment treatment for hyperthyroid patients.[24]
</p><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>People with autoimmune hyperthyroidism (such as in Grave's disease) should not eat foods high in iodine, such as edible seaweed and kelps.[1]
</p><p>From a public health perspective, the general introduction of iodized salt in the United States in 1924 resulted in lower disease, goiters, as well as improving the lives of children whose mothers would not have eaten enough iodine during pregnancy which would have lowered the IQs of their children.[25]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Surgery (thyroidectomy to remove the whole thyroid or a part of it) is not extensively used because most common forms of hyperthyroidism are quite effectively treated by the radioactive iodine method, and because there is a risk of also removing the parathyroid glands, and of cutting the recurrent laryngeal nerve, making swallowing difficult, and even simply generalized staphylococcal infection as with any major surgery. Some people with Graves' may opt for surgical intervention. This includes those that cannot tolerate medicines for one reason or another, people that are allergic to iodine, or people that refuse radioiodine.[26]
</p><p>If people have toxic nodules treatments typically include either removal or injection of the nodule with alcohol.[27]
</p><h3>Radioiodine[edit]</h3><p>In iodine-131 (radioiodine) radioisotope therapy, which was first pioneered by Dr. Saul Hertz,[28] radioactive iodine-131 is given orally (either by pill or liquid) on a one-time basis, to severely restrict, or altogether destroy the function of a hyperactive thyroid gland. This isotope of radioactive iodine used for ablative treatment is more potent than diagnostic radioiodine (usually iodine-123 or a very low amount of iodine-131), which has a biological half-life from 8–13 hours. Iodine-131, which also emits beta particles that are far more damaging to tissues at short range, has a half-life of approximately 8 days.  Patients not responding sufficiently to the first dose are sometimes given an additional radioiodine treatment, at a larger dose. Iodine-131 in this treatment is picked up by the active cells in the thyroid and destroys them, rendering the thyroid gland mostly or completely inactive.[29]
</p><p>Since iodine is picked up more readily (though not exclusively) by thyroid cells, and (more important) is picked up even more readily by over-active thyroid cells, the destruction is local, and there are no widespread side effects with this therapy. Radioiodine ablation has been used for over 50 years, and the only major reasons for not using it are pregnancy and breastfeeding (breast tissue also picks up and concentrates iodine). Once the thyroid function is reduced, replacement hormone therapy (levothyroxine) taken orally each day may easily provide the required amount of thyroid hormone the body needs.
</p><p>There is extensive experience, over many years, of the use of radioiodine in the treatment of thyroid overactivity and this experience does not indicate any increased risk of thyroid cancer following treatment. However, a study from 2007 has reported an increased cancer incidence after radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism.[29]
</p><p>The principal advantage of radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism is that it tends to have a much higher success rate than medications. Depending on the dose of radioiodine chosen, and the disease under treatment (Graves' vs. toxic goiter, vs. hot nodule etc.), the success rate in achieving definitive resolution of the hyperthyroidism may vary from 75-100%. A major expected side-effect of radioiodine in patients with Graves' disease is the development of lifelong hypothyroidism, requiring daily treatment with thyroid hormone. On occasion, some patients may require more than one radioactive treatment, depending on the type of disease present, the size of the thyroid, and the initial dose administered.[30]
</p><p>Graves' disease patients manifesting moderate or severe Graves' ophthalmopathy are cautioned against radioactive iodine-131 treatment, since it has been shown to exacerbate existing thyroid eye disease. Patients with mild or no ophthalmic symptoms can mitigate their risk with a concurrent six-week course of prednisone. The mechanisms proposed for this side effect involve a TSH receptor common to both thyrocytes and retro-orbital tissue.[31]
</p><p>As radioactive iodine treatment results in the destruction of thyroid tissue, there is often a transient period of several days to weeks when the symptoms of hyperthyroidism may actually worsen following radioactive iodine therapy. In general, this happens as a result of thyroid hormones being released into the blood following the radioactive iodine-mediated destruction of thyroid cells that contain thyroid hormone. In some patients, treatment with medications such as beta blockers (propranolol, atenolol, etc.) may be useful during this period of time.
</p><p>Most patients do not experience any difficulty after the radioactive iodine treatment, usually given as a small pill. On occasion, neck tenderness or a sore throat may become apparent after a few days, if moderate inflammation in the thyroid develops and produces discomfort in the neck or throat area. This is usually transient, and not associated with a fever, etc.
</p><p>Women breastfeeding should discontinue breastfeeding for at least a week, and likely longer, following radioactive iodine treatment, as small amounts of radioactive iodine may be found in breast milk even several weeks after the radioactive iodine treatment.
</p><p>A common outcome following radioiodine is a swing from hyperthyroidism to the easily treatable hypothyroidism, which occurs in 78% of those treated for Graves' thyrotoxicosis and in 40% of those with toxic multinodular goiter or solitary toxic adenoma.[32] Use of higher doses of radioiodine reduces the incidence of treatment failure, with penalty for higher response to treatment consisting mostly of higher rates of eventual hypothyroidism which requires hormone treatment for life.[33]
</p><p>There is increased sensitivity to radioiodine therapy in thyroids appearing on ultrasound scans as more uniform (hypoechogenic), due to densely packed large cells, with 81% later becoming hypothyroid, compared to just 37% in those with more normal scan appearances (normoechogenic).[34]
</p><h3>Thyroid storm[edit]</h3><p>Thyroid storm presents with extreme symptoms of hyperthyroidism.  It is treated aggressively with resuscitation measures along with a combination of the above modalities including: an intravenous beta blockers such as propranolol, followed by a thioamide such as methimazole, an iodinated radiocontrast agent or an iodine solution if the radiocontrast agent is not available, and an intravenous steroid such as hydrocortisone.[35]
</p>"
33,Hypoglycemia,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>The most effective means of preventing further episodes of hypoglycemia depends on the cause.
</p><p>The risk of further episodes of diabetic hypoglycemia can often (but not always) be reduced by lowering the dose of insulin or other medications, or by more meticulous attention to blood sugar balance during unusual hours, higher levels of exercise, or decreasing alcohol intake.
</p><p>Many of the inborn errors of metabolism require avoidance or shortening of fasting intervals, or extra carbohydrates. For the more severe disorders, such as type 1 glycogen storage disease, this may be supplied in the form of cornstarch every few hours or by continuous gastric infusion.
</p><p>Several treatments are used for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, depending on the exact form and severity. Some forms of congenital hyperinsulinism respond to diazoxide or octreotide. Surgical removal of the overactive part of the pancreas is curative with minimal risk when hyperinsulinism is focal or due to a benign insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas. When congenital hyperinsulinism is diffuse and refractory to medications, near-total pancreatectomy may be the treatment of last resort, but in this condition is less consistently effective and fraught with more complications.
</p><p>Hypoglycemia due to hormone deficiencies such as hypopituitarism or adrenal insufficiency usually ceases when the appropriate hormone is replaced.
</p><p>Hypoglycemia due to dumping syndrome and other post-surgical conditions is best dealt with by altering diet. Including fat and protein with carbohydrates may slow digestion and reduce early insulin secretion. Some forms of this respond to treatment with an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, which slows starch digestion.
</p><p>Reactive hypoglycemia with demonstrably low blood glucose levels is most often a predictable nuisance which can be avoided by consuming fat and protein with carbohydrates, by adding morning or afternoon snacks, and reducing alcohol intake.
</p><p>Idiopathic postprandial syndrome without demonstrably low glucose levels at the time of symptoms can be more of a management challenge. Many people find improvement by changing eating patterns (smaller meals, avoiding excessive sugar, mixed meals rather than carbohydrates by themselves), reducing intake of stimulants such as caffeine, or by making lifestyle changes to reduce stress. See the following section of this article.
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment of some forms of hypoglycemia, such as in diabetes, involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal through the eating of carbohydrates such as sugars, determining the cause, and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes. However, this treatment is not optimal in other forms such as reactive hypoglycemia, where rapid carbohydrate ingestion may lead to a further hypoglycemic episode.
</p><p>Blood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking (or receiving) 10–20 grams of carbohydrate.[31] It can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow. This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 3–4 ounces (100–120 ml) of orange, apple, or grape juice although fruit juices contain a higher proportion of fructose which is more slowly metabolized than pure dextrose. Alternatively, about 4–5 ounces (120–150 ml) of regular (non-diet) soda may also work, as will about one slice of bread, about 4 crackers, or about 1 serving of most starchy foods. Starch is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking acarbose), but adding fat or protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full recovery may take 10–20 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery and if the person has diabetes will simply produce hyperglycemia afterwards.  A mnemonic used by the American Diabetes Association and others is the ""rule of 15"" – consuming 15 grams of carbohydrate followed by a 15-minute wait, repeated if glucose remains low (variable by individual, sometimes 70 mg/dL).[32]
</p><p>If a person has such severe effects of hypoglycemia that they cannot (due to combativeness) or should not (due to seizures or unconsciousness) be given anything by mouth, medical personnel such as paramedics, or in-hospital personnel can establish IV access and give intravenous dextrose, concentrations varying depending on age (infants are given 2 ml/kg dextrose 10%, children are given dextrose 25%, and adults are given dextrose 50%). Care must be taken in giving these solutions because they can cause skin necrosis if the IV is infiltrated, sclerosis of veins, and many other fluid and electrolyte disturbances if administered incorrectly. If IV access cannot be established, the patient can be given 1 to 2 milligrams of glucagon in an intramuscular injection. More treatment information can be found in the article diabetic hypoglycemia.  If a person has less severe effects, and is conscious with the ability to swallow, medical personal may administer gelatinous oral glucose. The soft drink Lucozade has been used for hypoglycemia in the United Kingdom, however it has recently replaced much of its glucose with the artificial sugars, which do not treat hypoglycemia.[33]
</p><p>One situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is taking acarbose. Since acarbose and other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors prevents starch and other sugars from being broken down into monosaccharides that can be absorbed by the body, patients taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as glucose tablets, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia.

34,Osteoarthristis,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><div> People with osteoarthritis should do different kinds of exercise for different benefits to the body.</div><p>Lifestyle modification (such as weight loss and exercise) and analgesics are the mainstays of treatment. Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) is recommended first line with NSAIDs being used as add on therapy only if pain relief is not sufficient.[50] This is due to the relative greater safety of acetaminophen.[50]
</p><h3>Lifestyle changes[edit]</h3><p>For overweight people, weight loss may be an important factor.[51] Patient education has been shown to be helpful in the self-management of arthritis.[51] It decreases pain, improves function, reduces stiffness and fatigue, and reduces medical usage.[51] Patient education can provide on average 20% more pain relief when compared to NSAIDs alone in patients with hip osteoarthritis.[51]
</p><h3>Physical measures[edit]</h3><p>Moderate exercise may be beneficial with respect to pain and function in those with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip.[52][53][54] These exercises should occur at least three times per week.[55] While some evidence supports certain physical therapies, evidence for a combined program is limited.[56] Providing clear advice, making exercises enjoyable, and reassuring people about the importance of doing exercises may lead to greater benefit and more participation.[54] There is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of massage therapy.[57] The evidence for manual therapy is inconclusive.[58] Functional, gait, and balance training have been recommended to address impairments of position sense, balance, and strength in individuals with lower extremity arthritis as these can contribute to a higher rate of falls in older individuals.[59] For people with hand osteoarthritis, exercises may provide small benefits for improving hand function, reducing pain, and relieving finger joint stiffness.[60]
</p><p>Lateral wedge insoles and neutral insoles do not appear to be useful in osteoarthritis of the knee.[61][62][63] Knee braces may help[64] but their usefulness has also been disputed.[63] For pain management heat can be used to relieve stiffness, and cold can relieve muscle spasms and pain.[65] Among people with hip and knee osteoarthritis, exercise in water may reduce pain and disability, and increase quality of life in the short term.[66] Also therapeutic exercise programs such as aerobics and walking reduce pain and improve physical functioning for up to 6 months after the end of the program for people with knee osteoarthritis.[67]

</table><h4>By mouth[edit]</h4><p>The pain medication paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the first line treatment for osteoarthritis.[50][69] However, a 2015 review found acetaminophen to only have a small short term benefit with some laboratory concerns of liver inflammation.[70] For mild to moderate symptoms effectiveness of acetaminophen is similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen, though for more severe symptoms NSAIDs may be more effective.[50] NSAIDs are associated with greater side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding.[50] Diclofenac may be the most effective NSAID.[71]
</p><p>Another class of NSAIDs, COX-2 selective inhibitors (such as celecoxib) are equally effective when compared to nonselective NSAIDs, and have lower rates of adverse gastrointestinal effects, but higher rates of cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction.[72] They are also more expensive than non-specific NSAIDs.[73] Benefits and risks vary in individuals and need consideration when making treatment decisions,[74] and further unbiased research comparing NSAIDS and COX-2 selective inhibitors is needed.[75] NSAIDS applied topically are effective for a small number of people.[76] The COX-2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib was removed from the market in 2004, as cardiovascular events were associated with long term use.[77]
</p><p>Failure to achieve desired pain relief in osteoarthritis after 2 weeks should trigger reassessment of dosage and pain medication.[78] Opioids by mouth, including both weak opioids such as tramadol and stronger opioids, are also often prescribed. Their appropriateness is uncertain, and opioids are often recommended only when first line therapies have failed or are contraindicated.[3][79] This is due to their small benefit and relatively large risk of side effects.[80][81] Oral steroids are not recommended in the treatment of osteoarthritis.[69]
</p><p>Use of the antibiotic doxycycline orally for treating osteoarthritis is not associated with clinical improvements in function or joint pain.[82] Any small benefit related to the potential for doxycycline therapy to address the narrowing of the joint space is not clear, and any benefit is outweighed by the potential harm from side effects.[82]
</p><h4>Topical[edit]</h4><p>There are several NSAIDs available for topical use, including diclofenac. A Cochrane review from 2016 concluded that reasonably reliable evidence is available only for use of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen in people aged over 40 years with painful knee arthritis.[83] Transdermal opioid pain medications are not typically recommended in the treatment of osteoarthritis.[80] The use of topical capsaicin to treat osteoarthritis is controversial, as some reviews found benefit[84][85] while others did not.[86]
</p><h4>Joint injections[edit]</h4><div> Ultrasound-guided hip joint injection: A skin mark is made to mark the optimal point of entry for the needle.[87]</div><p>Joint injection of glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone) leads to short term pain relief that may last between a few weeks and a few months.[88] Injections of hyaluronic acid have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis,[89][90] but did increase risk of further pain.[89] In ankle osteoarthritis, evidence is unclear.[91] The effectiveness of injections of platelet-rich plasma is unclear; there are suggestions that such injections improve function but not pain, and are associated with increased risk.[vague][92][93]
</p><p>A 2015 Cochrane review found that intra-articular corticosteroid injections of the knee did not benefit quality of life and had no effect on knee joint space; clinical effects one to six weeks after injection could not be determined clearly due to poor study quality.[94] Another 2015 study reported negative effects of intra-articular corticosteroid injections at higher doses,[95] and a 2017 trial showed reduction in cartilage thickness with intra-articular triamcinolone every 12 weeks for 2 years compared to placebo.[96] A 2018 study found that intra-articular triamcinolone is associated with an increase in intraocular pressure.[97]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>If the impact of symptoms of osteoarthritis on quality of life is significant and more conservative management is ineffective, joint replacement surgery or resurfacing may be recommended. Evidence supports joint replacement for both knees and hips as it is both clinically effective,[98][99] and cost-effective.[100][101] Surgery to transfer articular cartilage from a non-weight-bearing area to the damaged area is one possible procedure that has some success, but there are problems getting the transferred cartilage to integrate well with the existing cartilage at the transfer site.[102]
</p><p>Osteotomy may be useful in people with knee osteoarthritis, but has not been well studied and it is unclear whether it is more effective than non-surgical treatments or other types of surgery.[103] Arthroscopic surgery is largely not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes in knee osteoarthritis,[104][105] and may result in harm.[106]
</p><p>For people who have shoulder osteoarthritis and do not respond to pharmaceutical approaches, surgical options include a shoulder hemiarthroplasty (replacing a part of the  joint), and total shoulder arthroplasty (replacing the joint).[107]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><h4>Glucosamine and chondroitin[edit]</h4><p>The effectiveness of glucosamine is controversial.[108] Reviews have found it to be equal to[109][110] or slightly better than placebo.[111][112] A difference may exist between glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride, with glucosamine sulfate showing a benefit and glucosamine hydrochloride not.[113] The evidence for glucosamine sulfate having an effect on osteoarthritis progression is somewhat unclear and if present likely modest.[114] The Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommends that glucosamine be discontinued if no effect is observed after six months[115] and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence no longer recommends its use.[8] Despite the difficulty in determining the efficacy of glucosamine, it remains a viable treatment option.[116] The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) recommends glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate for knee osteoarthritis.[117] Its use as a therapy for osteoarthritis is usually safe.[116][118]
</p><p>A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials of chondroitin found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects;  it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints.[119]
</p><h4>Other remedies[edit]</h4><p>Avocado–soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) is an extract made from avocado oil and soybean oil[120] that is sold under many brand names worldwide as a dietary supplement[121] and as a drug in France.[122]  A 2014 Cochrane review found that while ASU might help relieve pain in the short term for some people with osteoarthritis, it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. The review noted a high-quality two-year clinical trial comparing ASU to chondroitin, which has uncertain efficacy in osteoarthritis; the study found no difference between the two.[120] The review also found that although ASU appears to be safe, it has not been adequately studied for its safety to be determined.[120]
</p><p>A few high-quality studies of Boswellia serrata show consistent, but small, improvements in pain and function.[120] Curcumin,[123] phytodolor,[84] and s-adenosyl methionine (SAMe)[84][57] may be effective in improving pain. A 2009 Cochrane review recommended against the routine use of SAMe as there have not been sufficient high-quality trials performed to evaluate its effect.[124]  There is tentative evidence to support hyaluronan,[125] methylsulfonylmethane (MSM),[84] and rose hip.[84]
</p><p>There is little evidence supporting benefits for some supplements, including: the Ayurvedic herbal preparations with brand names Articulin F and Eazmov; Duhuo Jisheng Wan, a Chinese herbal preparation; fish liver oil; ginger; russian olive; the herbal preparation gitadyl; omega-3 fatty acids; the brand-name product Reumalax; stinging nettle; vitamins A, C, and E in combination; vitamin E alone; vitamin K; vitamin D; collagen; and willow bark. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about the safety and efficacy of these treatments.[84][126]
</p><h4>Acupuncture and other interventions[edit]</h4><p>While acupuncture leads to improvements in pain relief, this improvement is small and may be of questionable importance.[127] Waiting list–controlled trials for peripheral joint osteoarthritis do show clinically relevant benefits, but these may be due to placebo effects.[128][129] Acupuncture does not seem to produce long-term benefits.[130]
</p><p>While electrostimulation techniques such as TENS have been used for twenty years to treat osteoarthritis in the knee, there is no conclusive evidence to show that it reduces pain or disability.[131] A Cochrane review of low-level laser therapy found unclear evidence of benefit,[132] whereas another review found short-term pain relief for osteoarthritic knees.[133]
</p><p>Further research is needed to determine if balnotherapy for osteoarthritis (mineral baths or spa treatments) improves a person's quality of life or ability to function.[134] The use of ice or cold packs may be beneficial; however, further research is needed.[135] There is no evidence of benefit from placing hot packs on joints.[135]
</p><p>There is low quality evidence that therapeutic ultrasound may be beneficial for people with osteoarthritis of the knee; however, further research is needed to confirm and determine the degree and significance of this potential benefit.[136]
</p><p>There is weak evidence suggesting that electromagnetic field treatment may result in moderate pain relief; however, further research is necessary and it is not known if electromagnetic field treatment can improve quality of life or function.[137]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>There are ongoing efforts to determine if there are agents that modify outcomes in osteoarthritis. Sprifermin is one candidate drug. There is also tentative evidence that strontium ranelate may decrease degeneration in osteoarthritis and improve outcomes.[150][151]
</p><p>As well as attempting to find disease-modifying agents for osteoarthritis, there is emerging evidence that a system-based approach is necessary to find the causes of osteoarthritis.[152] Changes may occur before clinical disease is evident due to abnormalities in biomechanics, biology or structure of joints that predispose them to develop clinical disease. Research is thus focusing on defining these early pre-osteoarthritis changes using biological, mechanical, and imaging markers of osteoarthritis risk, emphasising multi-disciplinary approaches, and looking into personalized interventions that can reverse osteoarthritis risk in healthy joints before the disease becomes evident.
</p><p>Gene transfer strategies aim to target the disease process rather than the symptoms.[153]
</p><p>Cell-mediated gene therapy is being studied.[154][155] One version is approved in South Korea for the treatment of moderate knee osteoarthritis.[156] As of 2017[update], it is not approved in the United States, where it was developed.[156] The drug is administered intra-articularly.[156]
</p><h3>Biomarkers[edit]</h3><p>Guidelines outlining requirements for inclusion of soluble biomarkers in osteoarthritis clinical trials were published in 2015,[157] but as of 2015[update], there are no validated biomarkers for osteoarthritis. A 2015 systematic review of biomarkers for osteoarthritis looking for molecules that could be used for risk assessments found 37 different biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover in 25 publications.[158] The strongest evidence was for urinary C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen (uCTX-II) as a prognostic marker for knee osteoarthritis progression and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) levels as a prognostic marker for incidence of both knee and hip osteoarthritis. A review of biomarkers in hip osteoarthritis also found associations with uCTX-II.[159] Procollagen type II C-terminal propeptide (PIICP) levels reflect type II collagen synthesis in body and within joint fluid PIICP levels can be used as a prognostic marker for early osteoarthritis.[160]
</p><p>One problem with using a specific type II collagen biomarker from the breakdown of articular cartilage is that the amount of cartilage is reduced (worn away) over time with progression of the disease. As a result, a patient can eventually have very advanced osteoarthritis with none of this biomarker detectable in their urine. Another problem with a systemic biomarker is that a patient can have osteoarthritis in multiple joints at different stages of disease at the same time, so the biomarker source cannot be determined. Some other collagen breakdown products in the synovial fluid correlated with each other after acute injuries (a known cause of secondary osteoarthritis) but did not correlate with the severity of the injury.[161]
</p>"
35,Arthritis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>There is no known cure for either rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. Treatment options vary depending on the type of arthritis and include physical therapy, lifestyle changes (including exercise and weight control), orthopedic bracing, and medications. Joint replacement surgery may be required in eroding forms of arthritis. Medications can help reduce inflammation in the joint which decreases pain. Moreover, by decreasing inflammation, the joint damage may be slowed.[citation needed]
</p><h3>Physical therapy[edit]</h3><p>In general, studies have shown that physical exercise of the affected joint can noticeably improve long-term pain relief. Furthermore, exercise of the arthritic joint is encouraged to maintain the health of the particular joint and the overall body of the person.[42]
</p><p>Individuals with arthritis can benefit from both physical and occupational therapy. In arthritis the joints become stiff and the range of movement can be limited. Physical therapy has been shown to significantly improve function, decrease pain, and delay need for surgical intervention in advanced cases.[43] Exercise prescribed by a physical therapist has been shown to be more effective than medications in treating osteoarthritis of the knee. Exercise often focuses on improving muscle strength, endurance and flexibility. In some cases, exercises may be designed to train balance. Occupational therapy can provide assistance with activities. Assistive technology is a tool used to aid a person's disability by reducing their physical barriers by improving the use of their damaged body part, typically after an amputation. Assistive technology devices can be customized to the patient or bought commercially.[44]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>There are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis. Treatment typically begins with medications that have the fewest side effects with further medications being added if insufficiently effective.[45]
</p><p>Depending on the type of arthritis, the medications that are given may be different. For example, the first-line treatment for osteoarthritis is acetaminophen (paracetamol) while for inflammatory arthritis it involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Opioids and NSAIDs are less well tolerated.[46]
</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is autoimmune so, in addition to pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs, is treated with another category of drug called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which act on the immune system to slow down the progression of RA. An example of this type of drug is methotrexate.
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>A number of rheumasurgical interventions have been incorporated in the treatment of arthritis since the 1950s. Arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee provides no additional benefit to optimized physical and medical therapy.[47]
</p><h3>Adaptive aids[edit]</h3><p>People with hand arthritis can have trouble with simple activities of daily living tasks (ADLs), such as turning a key in a lock or opening jars, as these activities can be cumbersome and painful. There are adaptive aids or (assistive devices (ADs)) available to help with these tasks,[48] but they are generally more costly than conventional products with the same function. It is now possible to 3-D print adaptive aids, which have been released as open source hardware to reduce patient costs.[49][50] Adaptive aids can significantly help arthritis patients and the vast majority of those with arthritis need and use them.[51]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><p>Further research is required to determine if transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for knee osteoarthritis is effective for controlling pain.[52]
</p><p>Low level laser therapy may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis.[53] Evidence of benefit is tentative.[54]
</p><p>Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis.[55] The FDA has not approved PEMF for the treatment of arthritis. In Canada, PEMF devices are legally licensed by Health Canada for the treatment of pain associated with arthritic conditions.[citation needed]

36,(vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><h3>Repositioning maneuvers[edit]</h3><p>A number of maneuvers have been found to be effective including: the Epley maneuver, the Semont maneuver, and to a lesser degree Brandt–Daroff exercises.[5] Both the Epley and the Semont maneuver are equally effective.[5]
</p><h4>Epley maneuver[edit]</h4><div>Main article: Epley maneuver</div><p>The Epley maneuver employs gravity to move the calcium crystal build-up that causes the condition.[18] This maneuver can be performed during a clinic visit by health professionals, or taught to peoples to practice at home, or both.[19] Postural restriction after the Epley maneuver increases its effect somewhat.[20]
</p><p>When practiced at home, the Epley maneuver is more effective than the Semont maneuver. The most effective repositioning treatment for posterior canal BPPV is the therapist-performed Epley combined with home-practiced Epley maneuvers.[21]  Devices like the DizzyFIX can help users conduct the Epley maneuver at home, and are available for the treatment of BPPV.[22]
</p><p>The Epley maneuver does not address the actual presence of the particles (otoconia); rather it changes their location. The maneuver aims to move these particles from some locations in the inner ear which cause symptoms such as vertigo, and reposition them to where they do not cause these problems.
</p><h4>Semont maneuver[edit]</h4><div>Main article: Semont maneuver</div><p>The Semont maneuver has a cure rate of 90.3%.[23] It is performed as follows:
</p><ol>The person is seated on a treatment table with their legs hanging off the side of the table. The therapist then turns the person's head towards the unaffected side 45 degrees.
The therapist then quickly tilts the person so they are lying on the affected side. The head position is maintained, so their head is turned up 45 degrees. This position is maintained for 3 minutes. The purpose is to allow the debris to move to the apex of the ear canal.
The person is then quickly moved so they are lying on the unaffected side with their head in the same position (now facing downwards 45 degrees). This position is also held for 3 minutes. The purpose of this position is to allow the debris to move toward the exit of the ear canal.
Finally, the person is slowly brought back to an upright seated position. The debris should then fall into the utricle of the canal and the symptoms of vertigo should decrease or end completely.</ol><p>Some people will only need one treatment, but others may need multiple treatments, depending on the severity of their BPPV. In the Semont maneuver, as with the Epley maneuver, people themselves are able to achieve canalith repositioning.[19]
</p><h4>Brandt–Daroff exercises[edit]</h4><p>The Brandt–Daroff exercises may be prescribed by the clinician as a home treatment method, usually in conjunction with particle-repositioning maneuvers or in lieu of the particle-repositioning maneuver. The exercise is a form of habituation exercise, designed to allow the person to become accustomed to the position which causes the vertigo symptoms. The Brandt–Daroff exercises are performed in a similar fashion to the Semont maneuver; however, as the person rolls onto the unaffected side, the head is rotated toward the affected side.[24] The exercise is typically performed 3 times a day with 5–10 repetitions each time, until symptoms of vertigo have resolved for at least 2 days.[14]
</p><h4>Roll maneuver[edit]</h4><p>For the lateral (horizontal) canal, a separate maneuver has been used for productive results. It is unusual for the lateral canal to respond to the canalith repositioning procedure used for the posterior canal BPPV. Treatment is therefore geared towards moving the canalith from the lateral canal into the vestibule.[25]
The roll maneuver or its variations are used, and involve rolling the person 360 degrees in a series of steps to reposition the particles.[1] This maneuver is generally performed by a trained clinician who begins seated at the head of the examination table with the person supine[26] There are four stages, each a minute apart, and at the third position the horizontal canal is oriented in a vertical position with the person's neck flexed and on forearm and elbows.[26] When all four stages are completed, the head roll test is repeated, and if negative, treatment ceases.[26]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>Medical treatment with anti-vertigo medications may be considered in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, but in most cases are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the anti-histamine and anti-cholinergic class, such as meclizine and hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine), respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications) have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor- or ion channel-specific. Among them are betahistine or dexamethasone/gentamicin for the treatment of Ménière's disease, carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine for the treatment of paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, metoprolol/topiramate or valproic acid/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and 4-aminopyridine for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and both downbeat and upbeat nystagmus.[27] These drug therapies offer symptomatic treatment, and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate. Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the person's symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required, however, in order to determine the most effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long-term remission of the condition.[27]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Surgical treatments, such as a semi-circular canal occlusion, do exist for BPPV, but carry the same risk as any neurosurgical procedure. Surgery is reserved as a last resort option for severe and persistent cases which fail vestibular rehabilitation (including particle repositioning and habituation therapy).
</p>"
37,Acne,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Many different treatments exist for acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and salicylic acid.[75] They are believed to work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage.[76] Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.[19][77]
</p><p>Recommended therapies for first-line use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics.[78] Procedures such as light therapy and laser therapy are not considered to be first-line treatments and typically have an adjunctive role due to their high cost and limited evidence of efficacy.[77] Medications for acne work by targeting the early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; improvement in the appearance of acne is typically expected between six and eight weeks after starting therapy.[1]
</p><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>A diet low in simple sugars is recommended as a method of improving acne.[52] As of 2014, evidence is insufficient to recommend milk restriction for this purpose.[52]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><h4>Benzoyl peroxide[edit]</h4><div> The common acne vulgaris treatment benzoyl peroxide cream</div><p>Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is a first-line treatment for mild and moderate acne due to its effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought to interfere with the bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins.[79][80] Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation.[78][80] Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.[35]
</p><p>Side effects include increased skin photosensitivity, dryness, redness and occasional peeling.[81] Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide are just as effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects.[80][82] Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide does not appear to generate bacterial antibiotic resistance.[81]
</p><h4>Retinoids[edit]</h4><p>Retinoids are medications which reduce inflammation, normalize the follicle cell life cycle, and reduce sebum production.[44][83] They are structurally related to vitamin A.[83] The retinoids appear to influence the cell life cycle in the follicle lining. This helps prevent the accumulation of skin cells within the hair follicle that can create a blockage. They are a first-line acne treatment,[1] especially for people with dark-colored skin, and are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.[35]
</p><p>Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin.[46] They often cause an initial flare-up of acne and facial flushing, and can cause significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night.[1] Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more.[1][84] Tazarotene is the most effective and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated.[1][84] Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.
</p><p>Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid that is very effective for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments.[1][19] One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6 month course of oral isotretinoin.[1] After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission.[19] About 20% of patients require a second course.[19] Concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with an increased risk of adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims.[1][19] Isotretinoin is superior to antibiotics or placebo in reducing acne lesions.[16] The frequency of adverse events was about twice as high with isotretinoin, although these were mostly dryness-related events.[16] No increased risk of suicide or depression was conclusively found.[16] Isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy.[19] For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control.[19] In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy.[85] iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete.[85] The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.[85][86]
</p><h4>Antibiotics[edit]</h4><p>Antibiotics are frequently applied to the skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes and their ability to reduce inflammation.[19][81][87] With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective,[81] especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin.[15][87] Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline.[46] When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne.[19] Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications.[1] Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.[87]
</p><p>Oral antibiotics are recommended for no longer than three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration are associated with the development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses.[87] Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used at the same time to limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance.[87] Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics.[1] Topical dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.[10] While minocycline is shown to be an effective acne treatment, it is no longer recommended as a first-line antibiotic due to a lack of evidence that it is better than other treatments, and concerns of safety compared to other tetracyclines.[88]
</p><h4>Hormonal agents[edit]</h4><p>In women, acne can be improved with the use of any combined birth control pill.[89] These medications contain an estrogen and a progestin.[90] They work by decreasing the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries and by decreasing the free and hence biologically active fractions of androgens, resulting in lowered skin production of sebum and consequently reduced acne severity.[10][91] Although oral estrogens can decrease IGF-1 levels in some situations and this might be expected to additionally contribute to improvement in acne symptoms,[92][93] combined birth control pills appear to have no effect on IGF-1 levels in fertile women.[90][94] However, cyproterone acetate-containing birth control pills have been reported to decrease total and free IGF-1 levels.[95] Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins including desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, or norgestimate, as well as birth control pills containing cyproterone acetate or chlormadinone acetate, are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects.[96][97][98] Studies have shown a 40 to 70% reduction in acne lesions with combined birth control pills.[91] A 2014 review found that antibiotics by mouth appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months.[99] However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions.[99] The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.[99]
</p><p>Antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and spironolactone have been used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness.[10][46] Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combined birth control pills, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose.[1][35][100] The medication is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and is thought to be a useful acne treatment due to its ability to additionally block the androgen receptor at higher doses.[35] Alone or in combination with a birth control pill, spironolactone has shown a 33 to 85% reduction in acne lesions in women.[91] The effectiveness of spironolactone for acne appears to be dose-dependent.[91] High-dose cyproterone acetate alone has been found to decrease symptoms of acne in women by 75 to 90% within 3 months.[101] It is usually combined with an estrogen to avoid menstrual irregularities and estrogen deficiency.[102] The medication has also been found to be effective in the treatment of acne in males, with one study finding that a high dosage reduced inflammatory acne lesions by 73%.[103][104] However, the side effects of cyproterone acetate in males, such as gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and decreased bone mineral density, make its use for acne in this sex impractical in most cases.[103][104][105] Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male babies.[46] In addition, women who are sexually active and who can or may become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy while taking an antiandrogen.[106] Antiandrogens are often combined with birth control pills for this reason, which can result in additive efficacy.[35][107]
</p><p>Flutamide, a pure antagonist of the androgen receptor, is effective in the treatment of acne in women.[101][108] It has generally been found to reduce symptoms of acne by 80 or 90% even at low doses, with several studies showing complete acne clearance.[101][109][110] In one study, flutamide decreased acne scores by 80% within 3 months, whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same time period.[110][111][112] In a large long-term study, 97% of women reported satisfaction with the control of their acne with flutamide.[113] Although effective, flutamide has a risk of serious liver toxicity, and cases of death in women taking even low doses of the medication to treat androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions have occurred.[114] As such, the use of flutamide for acne has become increasingly limited,[113][115][116] and it has been argued that continued use of flutamide for such purposes is unethical.[114] Bicalutamide, a pure androgen receptor antagonist with the same mechanism as flutamide and with comparable or superior antiandrogenic efficacy but without its risk of liver toxicity, is a potential alternative to flutamide in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions in women.[106][117][118][119]
</p><p>Clascoterone is a topical antiandrogen which has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of acne in both males and females and is currently in the late stages of clinical development.[120][121][122][123] It has shown  no systemic absorption or associated antiandrogenic side effects.[122][123][124] In a direct head-to-head comparison, clascoterone showed greater effectiveness than topical isotretinoin.[122][123][124] 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride may be useful for the treatment of acne in both males and females, but have not been thoroughly evaluated for this purpose.[1][125][126][127] In addition, the high risk of birth defects with 5α-reductase inhibitors limits their use in women.[1][126] However, 5α-reductase inhibitors can be combined with birth control pills to prevent pregnancy, and are frequently used to treat excessive hair in women.[125] There is no evidence as of 2010 to support the use of cimetidine or ketoconazole in the treatment of acne.[128]
</p><p>Hormonal treatments for acne such as combined birth control pills and antiandrogens may be considered a first-line therapy for acne under a number of circumstances, including when contraception is desired, when known or suspected hyperandrogenism is present, when acne occurs in adulthood, when acne flares premenstrually, and when symptoms of significant sebum production (seborrhea) are co-present.[128] Hormone therapy is effective for acne even in women with normal androgen levels.[128]
</p><h4>Azelaic acid[edit]</h4><p>Azelaic acid has been shown to be effective for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration.[66][129] Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide 5%, isotretinoin 0.05%, and erythromycin 2%.[130] Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.[66] It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.[1] Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe.[131] It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.[1]
</p><h4>Salicylic acid[edit]</h4><p>Salicylic acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid that stops bacteria from reproducing and has keratolytic properties.[132][133] It opens obstructed skin pores and promotes shedding of epithelial skin cells.[132] Salicylic acid is known to be less effective than retinoid therapy.[19] Dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application, though darkening of the skin has been observed in individuals with darker skin types.[1]
</p><h4>Other medications[edit]</h4><p>Topical and oral preparations of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) have been suggested as alternative medical treatments.[134] It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, its ability to suppress sebum production, and by promoting wound healing.[134] Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited.[135] The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes.[135] Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.[136]
</p><p>Hydroquinone lightens the skin when applied topically by inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine to the skin pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.[34] By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time.[34] Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis.[34] The use of a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher in the morning with reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone.[34] Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area.[34] Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration.[34] Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people.[34] In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.[34]
</p><h4>Combination therapy[edit]</h4><p>Combination therapy—using medications of different classes together, each with a different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated to be a more efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy.[10][46] The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together has been shown to be more effective than antibiotics alone.[10] Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone.[10] Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide.[46] The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.[10]
</p><h3>Pregnancy[edit]</h3><p>Although the late stages of pregnancy are associated with an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity.[137] In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus.[137] Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B).[137] Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel.[46][137] Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm.[137] Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester.[137] Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy.[138] In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen in the second and third trimesters.[137] Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X).[137] Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects.[1] Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.[1]
</p><p>Topical antibiotics deemed safe during pregnancy include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption.[46][137] Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study.[46][137] No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone.[137] If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne.[19] Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins.[137] Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel.[1][137] Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.[137]
</p><h3>Procedures[edit]</h3><p>Comedo extraction is supported by limited evidence but is recommended for comedones that do not improve with standard treatment.[8][78] Another procedure for immediate relief is injection of a corticosteroid into an inflamed acne comedo.[78] Electrocautery and electrofulguration have also been reported as effective treatments for comedones.[139]
</p><p>Light therapy is a treatment method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths of light to an area of skin affected by acne. Both regular and laser light have been used.  When regular light is used immediately following the application of a sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate, the treatment is referred to as photodynamic therapy (PDT).[10][129] PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapies.[78] Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light) have been used to treat acne, including those that use infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO2 and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment is often referred to as laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized.[140] Ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with nonablative lasers, with examples being postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, persistent facial redness, and persistent pain.[8][141][142] Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum.[129]  As of 2012, evidence for various light therapies was insufficient to recommend them for routine use.[8] Disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost, the need for multiple visits, time required to complete the procedure(s), and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities.[10]  Various light therapies appear to provide a short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and for outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse;[76][143] it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications.[10] A 2016 meta-analysis was unable to conclude whether light therapies were more beneficial than placebo or no treatment, nor how long potential benefits lasted.[144] Typical side effects include skin peeling, temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.[10]
</p><p>Dermabrasion is an effective therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties.[31] Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth.[31] The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin.[31] Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor with the introduction of laser resurfacing.[31] Unlike dermabrasion, there is no evidence that microdermabrasion is an effective treatment for acne.[8]
</p><p>Dermal or subcutaneous fillers are substances injected into the skin to improve the appearance of acne scars. Fillers are used to increase natural collagen production in the skin and to increase skin volume and decrease the depth of acne scars.[145] Examples of fillers used for this purpose include hyaluronic acid; poly(methyl methacrylate) microspheres with collagen; human and bovine collagen derivatives, and fat harvested from the person's own body (autologous fat transfer).[145]
</p><p>Microneedling is a procedure in which an instrument with multiple rows of tiny needles is rolled over the skin to elicit a wound healing response and stimulate collagen production to reduce the appearance of atrophic acne scars in people with darker skin color.[140] Notable adverse effects of microneedling include postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and tram track scarring (described as discrete slightly raised scars in a linear distribution similar to a tram track). The latter is thought to be primarily attributable to improper technique by the practitioner, including the use of excessive pressure or inappropriately large needles.[140][146]
</p><p>Subcision is useful for treatment of superficial atrophic acne scars and involves the use of a small needle to loosen the fibrotic adhesions that result in the depressed appearance of the scar.[147][148][149]
</p><p>Chemical peels can be used to reduce the appearance of acne scars.[31] Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne.[31] Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis.[31] Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels.[31] Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.[31]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><p>Complementary therapies have been investigated for treating people with acne.[150] Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce the total number of skin lesions in those with acne.[150] Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis.[1] Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties.[65] Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality.[151] There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.[150]
</p><h3>Self-care[edit]</h3><p>Many over-the-counter treatments in many forms are available, which are often referred to as cosmeceuticals.[152] Certain types of makeup may be useful to mask acne.[153] In those with oily skin, a water-based product is often preferred.[153][154]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Efforts to better understand the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. The aim of this research is to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone).[10] Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators.[10] Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.[10]
</p><p>The use of antimicrobial peptides against P. acnes is under investigation as a treatment for acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance.[10] In 2007, the first genome sequencing of a P. acnes bacteriophage (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance.[178] Oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne.[179] Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content.[179] As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited.[179]
</p><p>Decreased levels of retinoic acid in the skin may contribute to comedo formation. To address this deficiency, methods to increase the skin's production of retinoid acid are being explored.[10] A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans.[49][180] Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.[181]

38,Urinary tract infection,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers.[4] There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching.[29] In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.[6] In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.[49]
</p><p>Using urinary catheters as little and as short of time as possible and appropriate care of the catheter when used prevents catheter-associated urinary tract infections.[32]
They should be inserted using sterile technique in hospital however non-sterile technique may be appropriate in those who self catheterize.[34] The urinary catheter set up should also be kept sealed.[34] Evidence does not support a significant decrease in risk when silver-alloy catheters are used.[50]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>For those with recurrent infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs is associated with the lowest antibiotic use.[16] A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective.[4] Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX).[6] Methenamine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop.[51] Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of antibiotic resistance.[16]
</p><p>In cases where infections are related to intercourse, taking antibiotics afterwards may be useful.[6] In post-menopausal women, topical vaginal estrogen has been found to reduce recurrence.[52][53] As opposed to topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics.[53] Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection.[54] A number of vaccines are in development as of 2018.[55][56]
</p><h3>Children</h3><p>The evidence that preventive antibiotics decrease urinary tract infections in children is poor.[57] However recurrent UTIs are a rare cause of further kidney problems if there are no underlying abnormalities of the kidneys, resulting in less than a third of a percent (0.33%) of chronic kidney disease in adults.[58] Whether routine circumcision prevents UTIs has not been well studied as of 2011.[59]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>Some research suggests that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections.[52][60] A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small.[61] Long-term tolerance is also an issue[61] with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%.[62] Cranberry juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication.[61] As of 2015, probiotics require further study to determine if they are beneficial.[63] The role of the urinary microbiome in maintaining urinary tract health is not well understood as of 2015.[64][65][66]
</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The mainstay of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed during the first few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection.[67] However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood).[68] Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers.[69] There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.[70][71]
</p><h3>Asymptomatic bacteriuria</h3><p>Those who have bacteria in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics.[72] This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, and those who have urinary catheters.[73][74] Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7 days of antibiotics.[75][76] If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth.[77] Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus[78] and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.[74]
</p><h3>Uncomplicated</h3><p>Uncomplicated infections can be diagnosed and treated based on symptoms alone.[4] Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line.[79] Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone may also be used.[80] However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing.[41] The FDA recommends against the use of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects.[81] These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective.[80][82] A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7 days.[4][83] Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.[41]
</p><p>With treatment, symptoms should improve within 36 hours.[17] About 50% of people will recover without treatment within a few days or weeks.[4] Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment.[41][84] The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication.[83] Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options.[85] Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these medications related to their widespread use.[4] Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries.[83] For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics.[86] Women with recurrent simple UTIs are over 90% accurate in identifying new infections.[4] They may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.[4]
</p><h3>Complicated</h3><p>Complicated UTIs are more difficult to treat and usually requires more aggressive evaluation, treatment and follow-up.[87] It may require identifying and addressing the underlying complication.[88] Increasing antibiotic resistance is causing concern about the future of treating those with complicated and recurrent UTI.[89][90]
</p><h3>Pyelonephritis</h3><p>Pyelonephritis is treated more aggressively than a simple bladder infection using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics.[3] Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used in areas where the resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed.[3] Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option.[91] In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed.[3] Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.[9][3]
</p>"
39,Psoriasis,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><div> Schematic of psoriasis treatment ladder</div><p>While no cure is available for psoriasis,[44] many treatment options exist. Topical agents are typically used for mild disease, phototherapy for moderate disease, and systemic agents for severe disease.[65]
</p><h3>Topical agents[edit]</h3><p>Topical corticosteroid preparations are the most effective agents when used continuously for 8 weeks; retinoids and coal tar were found to be of limited benefit and may be no better than placebo.[66] Greater benefit has been observed with very potent corticosteroids when compared to potent corticosteroids.
</p><p>Vitamin D analogues such as paricalcitol were found to be superior to placebo. Combination therapy with vitamin D and a corticosteroid was superior to either treatment alone and vitamin D was found to be superior to coal tar for chronic plaque psoriasis.[67]
</p><p>For psoriasis of the scalp, a 2016 review found dual therapy (vitamin D analogues and topical corticosteroids) or corticosteroid monotherapy to be more effective and safer than topical vitamin D analogues alone.[68] Due to their similar safety profiles and minimal benefit of dual therapy over monotherapy, corticosteroid monotherapy appears to be an acceptable treatment for short-term treatment.[68]
</p><p>Moisturizers and emollients such as mineral oil, petroleum jelly, calcipotriol, and decubal (an oil-in-water emollient) were found to increase the clearance of psoriatic plaques. Some emollients have been shown to be even more effective at clearing psoriatic plaques when combined with phototherapy.[69] However, certain emollients have no impact on psoriasis plaque clearance or may even decrease the clearance achieved with phototherapy, eg. the emollient salicylic acid is structurally similar to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), commonly found in sunscreen, and is known to interfere with phototherapy in psoriasis. Coconut oil, when used as an emollient in psoriasis, has been found to decrease plaque clearance with phototherapy.[69]  Medicated creams and ointments applied directly to psoriatic plaques can help reduce inflammation, remove built-up scale, reduce skin turnover, and clear affected skin of plaques. Ointment and creams containing coal tar, dithranol, corticosteroids (i.e. desoximetasone), fluocinonide, vitamin D3 analogs (for example, calcipotriol), and retinoids are routinely used. (The use of the finger tip unit may be helpful in guiding how much topical treatment to use.[35][70])
</p><p>Vitamin D analogues may be useful with steroids; however, alone have a higher rate of side effects.[71] They may allow less steroids to be used.[72]
</p><p>Another topical therapy used to treat psoriasis is a form of balneotherapy, which involves daily baths in the Dead Sea. This is usually done for four weeks with the benefit attributed to sun exposure and specifically UVB light. This is cost-effective and it has been propagated as an effective way to treat psoriasis without medication.[73] Decreases of PASI scores greater than 75% and remission for several months have commonly been observed.[73] Side-effects may be mild such as itchiness, folliculitis, sunburn, poikiloderma, and a theoretical risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer or melanoma has been suggested.[73] However, more recent studies have determined that there does not appear to be increased risk of melanoma in the long-term.[74] Data are inconclusive with respect to non-melanoma skin cancer risk, but support the idea that the therapy is associated with an increased risk of benign forms of sun-induced skin damage such as, but not limited to, actinic elastosis or liver spots.[74] Dead Sea balneotherapy is also effective for psoriatic arthritis.[74]
</p><h3>UV phototherapy[edit]</h3><p>Phototherapy in the form of sunlight has long been used for psoriasis.[65] UVB Wavelengths of 311–313 nanometers are most effective, and special lamps have been developed for this application.[65] The exposure time should be controlled to avoid over exposure and burning of the skin. The UVB lamps should have a timer that will turn off the lamp when the time ends. The amount of light used is determined by a person's skin type.[65] Increased rates of cancer from treatment appear to be small.[65] Narrow band UVB light (NBUVB) phototherapy has been demonstrated to have similar efficacy to Psoralen and ultraviolet A phototherapy (PUVA).[75] A 2013 meta-analysis found no difference in efficacy between NB-UVB and PUVA in the treatment of psoriasis, but NB-UVB is usually more convenient.[76]
</p><p>One of the problems with clinical phototherapy is the difficulty many patients have gaining access to a facility. Indoor tanning resources are almost ubiquitous today and could be considered as a means for patients to get UV exposure when dermatologist provided phototherapy is not available. Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis. One study found that plaque psoriasis is responsive to erythemogenic doses of either UVA or UVB, as exposure to either can cause dissipation of psoriatic plaques. It does require more energy to reach erythemogenic dosing with UVA.[77]
</p><p>UV light therapies all have risks; tanning beds are no exception, particularly in the link between UV light and the increased chance of skin cancer. There are increased risks of melanoma, squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas; younger psoriasis patients, particularly those under age 35, are at increased risk from melanoma from UV light treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) listed tanning beds as carcinogens. A review of studies recommends that people who are susceptible to skin cancers exercise caution when using UV light therapy as a treatment.[77]
</p><p>A major mechanism of NBUVB is the induction of DNA damage in the form of pyrimidine dimers. This type of phototherapy is useful in the treatment of psoriasis because the formation of these dimers interferes with the cell cycle and stops it. The interruption of the cell cycle induced by NBUVB opposes the characteristic rapid division of skin cells seen in psoriasis.[75] The activity of many types of immune cells found in the skin is also effectively suppressed by NBUVB phototherapy treatments. The most common short-term side effect of this form of phototherapy is redness of the skin; less common side effects of NBUVB phototherapy are itching and blistering of the treated skin, irritation of the eyes in the form of conjunctival inflammation or inflammation of the cornea, or cold sores due to reactivation of the herpes simplex virus in the skin surrounding the lips. Eye protection is usually given during phototherapy treatments.[75]
</p><p>Psoralen and ultraviolet A phototherapy (PUVA) combines the oral or topical administration of psoralen with exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The mechanism of action of PUVA is unknown, but probably involves activation of psoralen by UVA light, which inhibits the abnormally rapid production of the cells in psoriatic skin.  There are multiple mechanisms of action associated with PUVA, including effects on the skin's immune system. PUVA is associated with nausea, headache, fatigue, burning, and itching. Long-term treatment is associated with squamous cell carcinoma (but not with melanoma).[36][78]  A combination therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis using PUVA plus acitretin resulted in benefit, but acitretin use has been associated with birth defects and liver damage.[79]
</p><h3>Systemic agents[edit]</h3><div> Pictures of a patient with psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis) at baseline and 8 weeks after initiation of infliximab therapy.</div><p>Psoriasis resistant to topical treatment and phototherapy may be treated with systemic therapies including medications by mouth or injectable treatments.[80] People undergoing systemic treatment must have regular blood and liver function tests to check for medication toxicities.[80] Pregnancy must be avoided for most of these treatments. The majority of people experience a recurrence of psoriasis after systemic treatment is discontinued.
</p><p>Non-biologic systemic treatments frequently used for psoriasis include methotrexate, ciclosporin, hydroxycarbamide, fumarates such as dimethyl fumarate, and retinoids.[81] Methotrexate and ciclosporin are drugs that suppress the immune system; retinoids are synthetic forms of vitamin A. These agents are also regarded as first-line treatments for psoriatic erythroderma.[14] Oral corticosteroids should not be used, for they can severely flare psoriasis upon their discontinuation.[82]
</p><p>Biologics are manufactured proteins that interrupt the immune process involved in psoriasis. Unlike generalised immunosuppressive drug therapies such as methotrexate, biologics target specific aspects of the immune system contributing to psoriasis.[81] These medications are generally well-tolerated and limited long-term outcome data have demonstrated biologics to be safe for long-term use in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.[81][83] However, due to their immunosuppressive actions, biologics have been associated with a small increase in the risk for infection.[81]
</p><p>Guidelines regard biologics as third-line treatment for plaque psoriasis following inadequate response to topical treatment, phototherapy, and non-biologic systemic treatments.[83] The safety of biologics during pregnancy has not been assessed. European guidelines recommend avoiding biologics if a pregnancy is planned; anti-TNF therapies such as infliximab are not recommended for use in chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus or individuals infected with HIV.[81]
</p><p>Several monoclonal antibodies target cytokines, the molecules that cells use to send inflammatory signals to each other. TNF-α is one of the main executor inflammatory cytokines.  Four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol) and one recombinant TNF-α decoy receptor, etanercept, have been developed to inhibit TNF-α signaling.  Additional monoclonal antibodies, such as ixekizumab,[84] have been developed against pro-inflammatory cytokines[85] and inhibit the inflammatory pathway at a different point than the anti-TNF-α antibodies.[30]  IL-12 and IL-23 share a common domain, p40, which is the target of the recently FDA-approved ustekinumab.[32] In 2017 the US FDA approved guselkumab for plaque psoriasis.[86] There have been few studies of the efficacy of anti-TNF drugs for psoriasis in children. One randomized control study suggested that 12 weeks of etanercept treatment reduced the extent of psoriasis in children with no lasting adverse effects.[87]
</p><p>Two drugs that target T cells are efalizumab and alefacept. Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the CD11a subunit of LFA-1.[81] It also blocks the adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, which attract T cells. Efalizumab was voluntarily withdrawn from the European market in February 2009 and from the US market in June 2009 by the manufacturer due to the medication's association with cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.[81] Alefacept also blocks the molecules that dendritic cells use to communicate with T cells and even causes natural killer cells to kill T cells as a way of controlling inflammation.[30] Apremilast may also be used.[12]
</p><p>Individuals with psoriasis may develop neutralizing antibodies against monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization occurs when an antidrug antibody prevents a monoclonal antibody such as infliximab from binding antigen in a laboratory test. Specifically, neutralization occurs when the antidrug antibody binds to infliximab's antigen binding site instead of TNF-α. When infliximab no longer binds tumor necrosis factor alpha, it no longer decreases inflammation, and psoriasis may worsen. Neutralizing antibodies have not been reported against etanercept, a biologic drug that is a fusion protein composed of two TNF-α receptors. The lack of neutralizing antibodies against etanercept is probably secondary to the innate presence of the TNF-α receptor, and the development of immune tolerance.[88]
</p><p>A 2017 meta-analysis found that ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab were the most effective biologics for treating psoriasis.[89] In general, anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha biologics were found to be more effective than traditional systemic treatments.[89] The immunologic pathways of psoriasis involve TH-9, TH-22, TH-17 and TH-1 lymphocytes, and the above biologics hinder different aspects of these pathways.[90]
</p><p>Another treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis is fumaric acid esters (FAE) which may be similar in effectiveness to methotrexate.[91]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Limited evidence suggests removal of the tonsils may benefit people with chronic plaque psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, and palmoplantar pustulosis.[92][93]
</p><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>Uncontrolled studies have suggested that individuals with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis may benefit from a diet supplemented with fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).[94] Diet recommendations include consumption of cold water fish (preferably wild fish, not farmed) such as salmon, herring, and mackerel; extra virgin olive oil; legumes; vegetables; fruits; and whole grains; and avoid consumption of alcohol, red meat, and dairy products. The effect of consumption of caffeine (including coffee, black tea, mate, and dark chocolate) remains to be determined.[95]
</p><p>There is a higher rate of celiac disease among people with psoriasis.[95][96] When adopting a gluten-free diet, disease severity generally decreases in people with celiac disease and those with anti-gliadin antibodies.[94][97][98]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>The role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is currently under investigation. Preliminary research has suggested that antioxidants such as polyphenols may have beneficial effects on the inflammation characteristic of psoriasis.[118]
</p><p>Many novel medications being researched target the Th17/IL-23 axis,[118] particularly IL-23p19 inhibitors, as IL-23p19 is present in increased concentrations in psoriasis skin lesions while contributing less to protection against opportunistic infections.[119] Other cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22 also have been targets for inhibition as they play important roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.[119] Another avenue of research has focused on the use of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors to treat psoriasis.[58] Oral agents being investigated as alternatives to medications administered by injection include Janus kinase inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, all of which have proven effective in various phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.[118][119] However, these agents have potentially severe side-effects due to their immunosuppressive mechanisms.[119]
</p>"
40,Impetigo,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>To prevent the spread of impetigo the skin and any open wounds should be kept clean and covered. Care should be taken to keep fluids from an infected person away from the skin of a non-infected person. Washing hands, linens, and affected areas will lower the likelihood of contact with infected fluids. Scratching can spread the sores; keeping nails short will reduce the chances of spreading. Infected people should avoid contact with others and eliminate sharing of clothing or linens.[17]
</p><p>Children with impetigo can return to school 24 hours after starting antibiotic therapy as long as their draining lesions are covered.[18]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Antibiotics, either as a cream or by mouth, are usually prescribed. Mild cases may be treated with mupirocin ointments. In 95% of cases, a single 7-day antibiotic course results in resolution in children.[18][19] It has been advocated that topical antiseptics are not nearly as efficient as topical antibiotics, and therefore should not be used as a replacement.[3]
</p><p>More severe cases require oral antibiotics, such as dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, or erythromycin. Alternatively, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins (first-generation) and many others may also be used as an antibiotic treatment. Alternatives for people who are seriously allergic to penicillin or infections with methicillin-resistant Staphococcus aureus include doxycycline, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Although doxycycline should not be used in children under the age of eight years old due to the risk of drug-induced tooth discolouration.[18] When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice.
</p><p>When the condition presents with ulcers, valacyclovir, an antiviral, may be given in case a viral infection is causing the ulcer.
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><p>There is not enough evidence to recommend alternative medicine such as tea tree oil or honey.[3]
</p>"
41,Diabetes,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div>See also: Prevention of diabetes mellitus type 2</div><p>There is no known preventive measure for type 1 diabetes.[2] Type 2 diabetes—which accounts for 85–90% of all cases worldwide—can often be prevented or delayed by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity, and eating a healthy diet.[2] Higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%.[71] Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish.[72] Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent diabetes.[72] Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well.[73]
</p><p>The relationship between type 2 diabetes and the main modifiable risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. There is growing evidence that the underlying determinants of diabetes are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change: globalization, urbanization, population aging, and the general health policy environment.[74]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Diabetes management</div><div>Play media Overview of the management of diabetes</div><p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease, for which there is no known cure except in very specific situations.[75] Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal, without causing low blood sugar. This can usually be accomplished with a healthy diet, exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type 1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type 2 diabetes).
</p><p>Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.[76][77] The goal of treatment is an HbA1C level of 6.5%, but should not be lower than that, and may be set higher.[78] Attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the negative effects of diabetes. These include smoking, elevated cholesterol levels, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of regular exercise.[78] Specialized footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of ulceration, or re-ulceration, in at-risk diabetic feet. Evidence for the efficacy of this remains equivocal, however.[79]
</p><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><div>See also: Diabetic diet</div><p>People with diabetes can benefit from education about the disease and treatment, good nutrition to achieve a normal body weight, and exercise, with the goal of keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels within acceptable bounds. In addition, given the associated higher risks of cardiovascular disease, lifestyle modifications are recommended to control blood pressure.[80][81]
</p><p>No single dietary pattern is best for all people with diabetes. For overweight people with type 2 diabetes, any diet that achieves weight loss is effective.[82][83]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><h4>Glucose control[edit]</h4><div>See also: Anti-diabetic medication</div><p>Medications used to treat diabetes do so by lowering blood sugar levels. There is broad consensus that when people with diabetes maintain tight glucose control (also called ""tight glycemic control"") – keeping the glucose levels in their blood within normal ranges – that they experience fewer complications like kidney problems and eye problems.[84][85] There is however debate as to whether this is cost effective for people later in life.[86]
</p><p>There are a number of different classes of anti-diabetic medications. Some are available by mouth, such as metformin, while others are only available by injection such as GLP-1 agonists. Type 1 diabetes can only be treated with insulin, typically with a combination of regular and NPH insulin, or synthetic insulin analogs.[citation needed]
</p><p>Metformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment for type 2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.[6] It works by decreasing the liver's production of glucose.[87] Several other groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, may also decrease blood sugar in type II DM. These include agents that increase insulin release, agents that decrease absorption of sugar from the intestines, and agents that make the body more sensitive to insulin.[87] When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.[6] Doses of insulin are then increased to effect.[6][88]
</p><h4>Blood pressure[edit]</h4><p>Since cardiovascular disease is a serious complication associated with diabetes, some have recommended blood pressure levels below 130/80 mmHg.[89] However, evidence supports less than or equal to somewhere between 140/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg; the only additional benefit found for blood pressure targets beneath this range was an isolated decrease in stroke risk, and this was accompanied by an increased risk of other serious adverse events.[90][91] A 2016 review found potential harm to treating lower than 140 mmHg.[92] Among medications that lower blood pressure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improve outcomes in those with DM while the similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not.[93] Aspirin is also recommended for people with cardiovascular problems, however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.[94]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Weight loss surgery in those with obesity and type two diabetes is often an effective measure.[14] Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medications following surgery[95] and long-term mortality is decreased.[96] There is, however, a short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery.[97] The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear.[96] It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control.[98]
</p><p>A pancreas transplant is occasionally considered for people with type 1 diabetes who have severe complications of their disease, including end stage kidney disease requiring kidney transplantation.[99]
</p><h3>Support[edit]</h3><p>In countries using a general practitioner system, such as the United Kingdom, care may take place mainly outside hospitals, with hospital-based specialist care used only in case of complications, difficult blood sugar control, or research projects. In other circumstances, general practitioners and specialists share care in a team approach. Home telehealth support can be an effective management technique.[100]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Inhalable insulin has been developed.[125] The original products were withdrawn due to side effects.[125] Afrezza, under development by the pharmaceuticals company MannKind Corporation, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for general sale in June 2014.[126] An advantage to inhaled insulin is that it may be more convenient and easy to use.[127]
</p><p>Transdermal insulin in the form of a cream has been developed and trials are being conducted on people with type 2 diabetes.[128][129]
</p><h3>Major clinical trials[edit]</h3><p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was a clinical study conducted by the United States National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993. Test subjects all had diabetes mellitus type 1 and were randomized to a tight glycemic arm and a control arm with the standard of care at the time; people were followed for an average of seven years, and people in the treatment had dramatically lower rates of diabetic complications.  It was as a landmark study at the time, and significantly changed the management of all forms of diabetes.[86][130][131]
</p><p>The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a clinical study conducted by Z that was published in The Lancet in 1998. Around 3,800 people with type 2 diabetes were followed for an average of ten years, and were treated with tight glucose control or the standard of care, and again the treatment arm had far better outcomes.  This confirmed the importance of tight glucose control, as well as blood pressure control, for people with this condition.[86][132][133]
</p>"
42,Hypertension,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Much of the disease burden of high blood pressure is experienced by people who are not labeled as hypertensive.[87] Consequently, population strategies are required to reduce the consequences of high blood pressure and reduce the need for antihypertensive medications. Lifestyle changes are recommended to lower blood pressure, before starting medications. The 2004 British Hypertension Society guidelines[87] proposed lifestyle changes consistent with those outlined by the US National High BP Education Program in 2002[95] for the primary prevention of hypertension:
</p><ul>maintain normal body weight for adults (e.g. body mass index 20–25 kg/m2)
reduce dietary sodium intake to <100 mmol/ day (<6 g of sodium chloride or <2.4 g of sodium per day)
engage in regular aerobic physical activity such as brisk walking (≥30 min per day, most days of the week)
limit alcohol consumption to no more than 3 units/day in men and no more than 2 units/day in women
consume a diet rich in fruit and vegetables (e.g. at least five portions per day);</ul><p>Effective lifestyle modification may lower blood pressure as much as an individual antihypertensive medication. Combinations of two or more lifestyle modifications can achieve even better results.[87] There is considerable evidence that reducing dietary salt intake lowers blood pressure, but whether this translates into a reduction in mortality and cardiovascular disease remains uncertain.[96] Estimated sodium intake ≥6g/day and <3g/day are both associated with high risk of death or major cardiovascular disease, but the association between high sodium intake and adverse outcomes is only observed in people with hypertension.[97] Consequently, in the absence of results from randomized controlled trials, the wisdom of reducing levels of dietary salt intake below 3g/day has been questioned.[96] ESC guidelines mention periodontitis is associated with poor cardiovascular health status.[98]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of hypertension</div><p>According to one review published in 2003, reduction of the blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischemic heart disease by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease.[99]
</p><h3>Target blood pressure[edit]</h3><div>See also: Comparison of international blood pressure guidelines</div><p>Various expert groups have produced guidelines regarding how low the blood pressure target should be when a person is treated for hypertension. These groups recommend a target below the range 140–160 / 90–100 mmHg for the general population.[13][12][100][101][102] Cochrane reviews recommend similar targets for subgroups such as people with diabetes[103] and people with prior cardiovascular disease.[104]
</p><p>Many expert groups recommend a slightly higher target of 150/90 mmHg for those over somewhere between 60 and 80 years of age.[12][100][101][105] The JNC-8 and American College of Physicians recommend the target of 150/90 mmHg for those over 60 years of age,[13][106] but some experts within these groups disagree with this recommendation.[107] Some expert groups have also recommended slightly lower targets in those with diabetes[12] or chronic kidney disease with protein loss in the urine,[108] but others recommend the same target as for the general population.[13][103] The issue of what is the best target and whether targets should differ for high risk individuals is unresolved,[109] although some experts propose more intensive blood pressure lowering than advocated in some guidelines.[110]
</p><p>For people who have never experienced cardiovascular disease who are at a 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease of less than 10%, the 2017 American Heart Association guidelines recommend medications if the systolic blood pressure is >140 mmHg or if the diastolic BP is >90 mmHg.[7] For people who have experienced cardiovascular disease or those who are at a 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease of greater than 10%, it recommends medications if the systolic blood pressure is >130 mmHg or if the diastolic BP is >80 mmHg.[7]
</p><h3>Lifestyle modifications[edit]</h3><p>The first line of treatment for hypertension is lifestyle changes, including dietary changes, physical exercise, and weight loss. Though these have all been recommended in scientific advisories,[111] a  Cochrane systematic review found no evidence for effects of weight loss diets on death, long-term complications or adverse events in persons with hypertension.[112] The review did find a decrease in blood pressure.[112] Their potential effectiveness is similar to and at times exceeds a single medication.[12] If hypertension is high enough to justify immediate use of medications, lifestyle changes are still recommended in conjunction with medication.
</p><p>Dietary changes shown to reduce blood pressure include diets with low sodium,[113][114][115] the DASH diet,[116] vegetarian diets,[117] and green tea consumption.[118][119][120][121]
</p><p>Increasing dietary potassium has a potential benefit for lowering the risk of hypertension.[122][123] The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) stated that potassium is one of the shortfall nutrients which is under-consumed in the United States.[124] However, people who take certain antihypertensive medications (such as ACE-inhibitors or ARBs) should not take potassium supplements or potassium-enriched salts due to the risk of high levels of potassium.[125]
</p><p>Physical exercise regimens which are shown to reduce blood pressure include isometric resistance exercise, aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and device-guided breathing.[126]
</p><p>Stress reduction techniques such as biofeedback or transcendental meditation may be considered as an add-on to other treatments to reduce hypertension, but do not have evidence for preventing cardiovascular disease on their own.[126][127][128] Self-monitoring and appointment reminders might support the use of other strategies to improve blood pressure control, but need further evaluation.[129]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as antihypertensive medications, are available for treating hypertension.
</p><p>First-line medications for hypertension include thiazide-diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).[13] These medications may be used alone or in combination (ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended for use in combination); the latter option may serve to minimize counter-regulatory mechanisms that act to restore blood pressure values to pre-treatment levels.[13][130] Most people require more than one medication to control their hypertension.[111] Medications for blood pressure control should be implemented by a stepped care approach when target levels are not reached.[129]
</p><p>Previously beta-blockers such as atenolol were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, a Cochrane review that included 13 trials found that the effects of beta-blockers are inferior to that of other antihypertensive medications in preventing cardiovascular disease.[131]
</p><h3>Resistant hypertension[edit]</h3><p>Resistant hypertension is defined as high blood pressure that remains above a target level, in spite of being prescribed three or more antihypertensive drugs simultaneously with different mechanisms of action.[132] Failing to take the prescribed drugs, is an important cause of resistant hypertension.[133] Resistant hypertension may also result from chronically high activity of the autonomic nervous system, an effect known as ""neurogenic hypertension"".[134] Electrical therapies that stimulate the baroreflex are being studied as an option for lowering blood pressure in people in this situation.[135]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>A 2015 review of several studies found that restoring blood vitamin D levels by using supplements (more than 1,000 IU per day) reduced blood pressure in hypertensive individuals when they had existing vitamin D deficiency.[168] The results also demonstrated a correlation of chronically low vitamin D levels with a higher chance of becoming hypertensive. Supplementation with vitamin D over 18 months in normotensive individuals with vitamin D deficiency did not significantly affect blood pressure.[168]
</p><p>There is tentative evidence that an increased calcium intake may help in preventing hypertension. However, more studies are needed to assess the optimal dose and the possible side effects.[169]

43,(vertigo) Paroymsal Positional Vertigo,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><h3>Repositioning maneuvers[edit]</h3><p>A number of maneuvers have been found to be effective including: the Epley maneuver, the Semont maneuver, and to a lesser degree Brandt–Daroff exercises.[5] Both the Epley and the Semont maneuver are equally effective.[5]
</p><h4>Epley maneuver[edit]</h4><div>Main article: Epley maneuver</div><p>The Epley maneuver employs gravity to move the calcium crystal build-up that causes the condition.[18] This maneuver can be performed during a clinic visit by health professionals, or taught to peoples to practice at home, or both.[19] Postural restriction after the Epley maneuver increases its effect somewhat.[20]
</p><p>When practiced at home, the Epley maneuver is more effective than the Semont maneuver. The most effective repositioning treatment for posterior canal BPPV is the therapist-performed Epley combined with home-practiced Epley maneuvers.[21]  Devices like the DizzyFIX can help users conduct the Epley maneuver at home, and are available for the treatment of BPPV.[22]
</p><p>The Epley maneuver does not address the actual presence of the particles (otoconia); rather it changes their location. The maneuver aims to move these particles from some locations in the inner ear which cause symptoms such as vertigo, and reposition them to where they do not cause these problems.
</p><h4>Semont maneuver[edit]</h4><div>Main article: Semont maneuver</div><p>The Semont maneuver has a cure rate of 90.3%.[23] It is performed as follows:
</p><ol>The person is seated on a treatment table with their legs hanging off the side of the table. The therapist then turns the person's head towards the unaffected side 45 degrees.
The therapist then quickly tilts the person so they are lying on the affected side. The head position is maintained, so their head is turned up 45 degrees. This position is maintained for 3 minutes. The purpose is to allow the debris to move to the apex of the ear canal.
The person is then quickly moved so they are lying on the unaffected side with their head in the same position (now facing downwards 45 degrees). This position is also held for 3 minutes. The purpose of this position is to allow the debris to move toward the exit of the ear canal.
Finally, the person is slowly brought back to an upright seated position. The debris should then fall into the utricle of the canal and the symptoms of vertigo should decrease or end completely.</ol><p>Some people will only need one treatment, but others may need multiple treatments, depending on the severity of their BPPV. In the Semont maneuver, as with the Epley maneuver, people themselves are able to achieve canalith repositioning.[19]
</p><h4>Brandt–Daroff exercises[edit]</h4><p>The Brandt–Daroff exercises may be prescribed by the clinician as a home treatment method, usually in conjunction with particle-repositioning maneuvers or in lieu of the particle-repositioning maneuver. The exercise is a form of habituation exercise, designed to allow the person to become accustomed to the position which causes the vertigo symptoms. The Brandt–Daroff exercises are performed in a similar fashion to the Semont maneuver; however, as the person rolls onto the unaffected side, the head is rotated toward the affected side.[24] The exercise is typically performed 3 times a day with 5–10 repetitions each time, until symptoms of vertigo have resolved for at least 2 days.[14]
</p><h4>Roll maneuver[edit]</h4><p>For the lateral (horizontal) canal, a separate maneuver has been used for productive results. It is unusual for the lateral canal to respond to the canalith repositioning procedure used for the posterior canal BPPV. Treatment is therefore geared towards moving the canalith from the lateral canal into the vestibule.[25]
The roll maneuver or its variations are used, and involve rolling the person 360 degrees in a series of steps to reposition the particles.[1] This maneuver is generally performed by a trained clinician who begins seated at the head of the examination table with the person supine[26] There are four stages, each a minute apart, and at the third position the horizontal canal is oriented in a vertical position with the person's neck flexed and on forearm and elbows.[26] When all four stages are completed, the head roll test is repeated, and if negative, treatment ceases.[26]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>Medical treatment with anti-vertigo medications may be considered in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, but in most cases are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the anti-histamine and anti-cholinergic class, such as meclizine and hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine), respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications) have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor- or ion channel-specific. Among them are betahistine or dexamethasone/gentamicin for the treatment of Ménière's disease, carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine for the treatment of paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, metoprolol/topiramate or valproic acid/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and 4-aminopyridine for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and both downbeat and upbeat nystagmus.[27] These drug therapies offer symptomatic treatment, and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate. Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the person's symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required, however, in order to determine the most effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long-term remission of the condition.[27]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Surgical treatments, such as a semi-circular canal occlusion, do exist for BPPV, but carry the same risk as any neurosurgical procedure. Surgery is reserved as a last resort option for severe and persistent cases which fail vestibular rehabilitation (including particle repositioning and habituation therapy).
