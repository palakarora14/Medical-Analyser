0,Alzheimer's disease,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div> Intellectual activities such as playing chess or regular social interaction have been linked to a reduced risk of AD in epidemiological studies, although no causal relationship has been found.</div><p>There is no definitive evidence to support that any particular measure is effective in preventing AD.[13] Global studies of measures to prevent or delay the onset of AD have often produced inconsistent results.
Epidemiological studies have proposed relationships between certain modifiable factors, such as diet, cardiovascular risk, pharmaceutical products, or intellectual activities among others, and a population's likelihood of developing AD. Only further research, including clinical trials, will reveal whether these factors can help to prevent AD.[13]
</p><h3>Medication</h3><p>Although cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, are associated with a higher risk of onset and course of AD,[134][135] statins, which are cholesterol lowering drugs, have not been effective in preventing or improving the course of the disease.[136][137][138]
</p><p>Long-term usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were thought in 2007 to be associated with a reduced likelihood of developing AD.[139] Evidence also suggested the notion that NSAIDs could reduce inflammation related to amyloid plaques, but trials were suspended due to high adverse events.[13] No prevention trial has been completed.[13] They do not appear to be useful as a treatment, but as of 2011[update] were thought to be candidates as presymptomatic preventatives.[140] Hormone replacement therapy in menopause, although previously used, may increase the risk of dementia.[141]
</p><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>People who engage in intellectual activities such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease.[142] This is compatible with the cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations.[142] Education delays the onset of AD syndrome without changing the duration of the disease.[143] Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease.[144]
Physical activity is also associated with a reduced risk of AD.[143] Physical exercise is associated with decreased rate of dementia.[145] Physical exercise is also effective in reducing symptom severity in those with Alzheimer's disease.[146]
</p><h3>Diet</h3><p>People who maintain a healthy, Japanese, or Mediterranean diet have a reduced risk of AD.[147] A Mediterranean diet may improve outcomes in those with the disease.[148] Those who eat a diet high in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates (mono- and disaccharide) have a higher risk.[149] The Mediterranean diet's beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as the mechanism of action.[150]
</p><p>Conclusions on dietary components have at times been difficult to ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials.[147] There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of AD.[147] There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective.[151] A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.[152][153]
</p><p>Reviews on the use of vitamins and minerals have not found enough consistent evidence to recommend them. This includes vitamin A,[154][155] C,[156][157] the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E,[158] selenium,[159] zinc,[160][161] and folic acid with or without vitamin B12.[162] Evidence from one randomized controlled trial indicated that the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E may slow cognitive decline, this evidence was judged to be ""moderate"" in quality.[158] Trials examining folic acid (B9) and other B vitamins failed to show any significant association with cognitive decline.[163] Omega-3 fatty acid supplements from plants and fish, and dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), do not appear to benefit people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.[164][165]
</p><p>Curcumin as of 2010[update] had not shown benefit in people even though there is tentative evidence in animals.[166] There was inconsistent and unconvincing evidence that ginkgo has any positive effect on cognitive impairment and dementia.[167] As of 2008[update] there was no concrete evidence that cannabinoids are effective in improving the symptoms of AD or dementia;[168] however, some research into endocannabinoids looked promising.[169]
</p><h2>Management</h2><p>There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefit but remain palliative in nature. Current treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.
</p><h3>Medications</h3><div> Three-dimensional molecular model of donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of AD symptoms</div><div> Molecular structure of memantine, a medication approved for advanced AD symptoms</div><p>Five medications are currently used to treat the cognitive problems of AD: four are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil) and the other (memantine) is an NMDA receptor antagonist. The benefit from their use is small.[6][170][171] No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the progression of the disease.
</p><p>Reduction in the activity of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease.[172] Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons.[173] There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease,[174][171][170] and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage.[170] The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD.[175] The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses.[176] Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.[174]
</p><p>Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter of the nervous system, although excessive amounts in the brain can lead to cell death through a process called excitotoxicity which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate receptors. Excitotoxicity occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.[177] Memantine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist first used as an anti-influenza agent. It acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate.[177][178] Memantine has been shown to have a small benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.[179] Reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild, including hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue.[180] The combination of memantine and donepezil has been shown to be ""of statistically significant but clinically marginal effectiveness"".[181]
</p><p>Atypical antipsychotics are modestly useful in reducing aggression and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline.[182] When used in the long-term, they have been shown to associate with increased mortality.[183] Stopping antipsychotic use in this group of people appears to be safe.[184]
</p><p>Huperzine A while promising, requires further evidence before its use can be recommended.[185]
</p><h3>Psychosocial intervention</h3><p>Psychosocial interventions are used as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment and can be classified within behaviour-, emotion-, cognition- or stimulation-oriented approaches. Research on efficacy is unavailable and rarely specific to AD, focusing instead on dementia in general.[186]
</p><p>Behavioural interventions attempt to identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning,[187] but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as incontinence.[188] There is a lack of high quality data on the effectiveness of these techniques in other behaviour problems such as wandering.[189][190] Music therapy is effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms.[191]
</p><p>Emotion-oriented interventions include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, also called snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A Cochrane review has found no evidence that this is effective.[192] Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness.[186] Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. A 2018 review of the effectiveness of RT found that effects were inconsistent, small in size and of doubtful clinical significance, and varied by setting.[193] Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.[194]
Finally, validation therapy is based on acceptance of the reality and personal truth of another's experience, while sensory integration is based on exercises aimed to stimulate senses. There is no evidence to support the usefulness of these therapies.[195][196]
</p><p>The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and cognitive retraining, is the reduction of cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities,[197][198] although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.[186]
</p><p>Stimulation-oriented treatments include art, music and pet therapies, exercise, and any other kind of recreational activities. Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function. Nevertheless, as important as these effects are, the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the change in the person's routine.[186] The efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation and invasive brain stimulation in AD remains uncertain.[199]
</p><h3>Caregiving</h3><div>Further information: Caregiving and dementia</div><p>Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, caregiving is essentially the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease.
</p><p>During the early and moderate stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden.[200][201] Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue the person with the disease or the use of modified daily life objects.[186][202][203] If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even pureed.[204] When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members.[205][206] The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers.[186]
</p><p>As the disease progresses, different medical issues can appear, such as oral and dental disease, pressure ulcers, malnutrition, hygiene problems, or respiratory, skin, or eye infections. Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed when they do arise.[207][208] During the final stages of the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death, often with the help of hospice.[209]
</p><h2>Research directions</h2><div>Main article: Alzheimer's disease research</div><h3>Medication</h3><p>In the decade 2002–2012, 244 compounds were assessed in Phase I, Phase II, or Phase III trials, and only one of these (memantine) received FDA approval (though others were still in the pipeline).[253] Solanezumab and aducanumab failed to show effectiveness in people who already had Alzheimer's symptoms.[254]
</p><p>One area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds[255] (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study.[256] Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy would be used to treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease.[257] An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001,[258][259] although the trials were suspended in 2008.[260] Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody.[261] However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities.[262] Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108,[263] and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2.[264] A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.[265]
</p><p>In 2008, two separate clinical trials showed positive results in modifying the course of disease in mild to moderate AD with methylthioninium chloride, a drug that inhibits tau aggregation,[266][267] and dimebon, an antihistamine.[268]
The consecutive phase-III trial of dimebon failed to show positive effects in the primary and secondary endpoints.[269][270][271] Work with methylthioninium chloride showed that bioavailability of methylthioninium from the gut was affected by feeding and by stomach acidity, leading to unexpectedly variable dosing.[272] A new stabilised formulation, as the prodrug LMTX, is in phase-III trials (in 2014).[273]
</p><h3>Behavioral prevention</h3><p>Preliminary research on the effects of meditation on retrieving memory and cognitive functions have been encouraging.[274][qualify evidence]  A 2015 review suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may prevent or delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.[275]
</p><h3>Possible transmission</h3><p>Rare cases of possible transmission between people are being studied,[276] e.g. to growth hormone patients.[277]
</p><h3>Infections</h3><p>The herpes simplex virus HSV-1 has been found in the same areas as amyloid plaques.[278] This suggested the possibility that AD could be treated or prevented with antiviral medication.[278][279] Studies of antivirals in cell cultures have shown promising results.[280]
</p><p>Fungal infection of AD brain has also been described.[281]
This hypothesis was proposed by the microbiologist L. Carrasco when his group found statistical correlation between disseminated mycoses and AD.[282]
Further work revealed that fungal infection is present in different brain regions of AD patients, but not in the control individuals.[283]
[284]
A fungal infection explains the symptoms observed in AD patients. The slow progression of AD fits with the chronic nature of some systemic fungal infections, which can be asymptomatic and thus, unnoticed and untreated.[283]
The fungal hypotheses are also compatible with some other established AD hypotheses, like the amyloid hypothesis, that can be explained as an immune system response to an infection in the CNS,[285][286][287] as found by R. Moir and R. Tanzi in mouse and worm models of AD.

</p><p>PiB PET remains investigational, but a similar PET scanning radiopharmaceutical called florbetapir, containing the longer-lasting radionuclide fluorine-18, is a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease.[289][290]
</p><p>Amyloid imaging is likely to be used in conjunction with other markers rather than as an alternative.[291] Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.[292]
</p><p>In 2011 An FDA panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of florbetapir. The imaging agent can help to detect Alzheimer's brain plaques.[293] A negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD.[294]
</p><h3>Diagnosis</h3><p>Emphasis in Alzheimer's research has been placed on diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin.[295] A number of biochemical tests have been developed to enable earlier detection. Some such tests involve the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for beta-amyloid, total tau protein and phosphorylated tau181P protein concentrations.[296] Because drawing CSF can be painful, repeated draws are avoided. A blood test for circulatory miRNA and inflammatory biomarkers is a potential alternative indicator.[296]

1,HIV,"<h2>Research</h2><div>Main article: HIV/AIDS research</div><p>HIV/AIDS research includes all medical research that attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, as well as fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.
</p><p>Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions, such as research into sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and anti-retroviral drugs.[112] Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, circumcision and HIV, and accelerated aging effects.
</p><h2>Treatment and Transmission</h2><div>Main article: Management of HIV/AIDS</div><p>The management of HIV/AIDS normally includes the use of multiple antiretroviral drugs. In many parts of the world, HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare.
</p><p>HIV latency, and the consequent viral reservoir in CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, as well as macrophages, is the main barrier to eradication of the virus.[16]
</p><p>It is important to note that although HIV is highly virulent, transmission does not occur through sex when an HIV-positive person has a consistently undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ml) due to anti-retroviral treatment. Previously it was said the chance of transmission was 'very low' or 'negligable' (The 'Swiss Statement').[113] However, following multiple studies its is now clear that the chance of passing on HIV through sex is zero where the HIV-positive person has a consistently undetectable viral load, this is known as 'U=U' or 'Undetectable=Untransmittable', also phrased as 'can't pass it on'.[114][115] The studies demonstrating U=U are; Opposites Attract, PARTNER 1, PARTNER 2, and HPTN052.[116][117][118][119] In these studies couples where one partner was HIV positive and one partner was HIV negative were enrolled and regular HIV testing completed. In total from the four studies, 4097 couples were enrolled over four continents and 151,880 acts of condomless sex were reported, there were zero phylogenetically linked transmissions of HIV where the positive partner had an undetecable viral load.[120] Following this the U=U consensus statement advocating the use of 'zero risk' was signed by hundreds of individuals and organisations including the US CDC, British HIV Association and The Lancet medical journal.[121]

2,Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>In immunocompromised patients, prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole),[9] atovaquone, or regular pentamidine inhalations may help prevent PCP.
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Antipneumocystic medication is used with concomitant steroids  to avoid inflammation, which causes an exacerbation of symptoms about 4 days after treatment begins if steroids are not used. By far, the most commonly used medication is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but some patients are unable to tolerate this treatment due to allergies. Other medications that are used, alone or in combination, include pentamidine, trimetrexate, dapsone, atovaquone, primaquine, pafuramidine maleate (under investigation), and clindamycin. Treatment is usually for a period of about 21 days.
</p><p>Pentamidine is less often used, as its major limitation is the high frequency of side effects. These include acute pancreatic inflammation, kidney failure, liver toxicity, decreased white blood cell count, rash, fever, and low blood sugar.
</p>"
3,accident cerebrovascular,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>Given the disease burden of strokes, prevention is an important public health concern.[66] Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year).[66] Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke.[67] In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended.[68] In people who have had a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a first stroke.[69][70] In those who have previously had a stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial.[69] The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.[71]
</p><h3>Risk factors</h3><p>The most important modifiable risk factors for stroke are high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation although the size of the effect is small with 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke.[72][73] Other modifiable risk factors include high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking[74][75] (active and passive), heavy alcohol use,[76] drug use,[77] lack of physical activity, obesity, processed red meat consumption,[78] and unhealthy diet.[79] Smoking just one cigarette per day increases the risk more than 30%.[80] Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, and intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound thrombocytosis and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances).[81] Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension.[82][83] Migraine with aura doubles a person's risk for ischemic stroke.[84][85] Untreated, celiac disease regardless of the presence of symptoms can be an underlying cause of stroke, both in children and adults.[86]
</p><p>High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of stroke by about 26%.[87] There is a lack of high quality studies looking at promotional efforts to improve lifestyle factors.[88] Nonetheless, given the large body of circumstantial evidence, best medical management for stroke includes advice on diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol use.[89] Medication is the most common method of stroke prevention; carotid endarterectomy can be a useful surgical method of preventing stroke.
</p><h4>Blood pressure</h4><p>High blood pressure accounts for 35–50% of stroke risk.[90] Blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg systolic or 5 mmHg diastolic reduces the risk of stroke by ~40%.[91] Lowering blood pressure has been conclusively shown to prevent both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.[92][93] It is equally important in secondary prevention.[94] Even patients older than 80 years and those with isolated systolic hypertension benefit from antihypertensive therapy.[95][96][97] The available evidence does not show large differences in stroke prevention between antihypertensive drugs—therefore, other factors such as protection against other forms of cardiovascular disease and cost should be considered.[98][99] The routine use of beta-blockers following a stroke or TIA has not been shown to result in benefits.[100]
</p><h4>Blood lipids</h4><p>High cholesterol levels have been inconsistently associated with (ischemic) stroke.[93][101] Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by about 15%.[102] Since earlier meta-analyses of other lipid-lowering drugs did not show a decreased risk,[103] statins might exert their effect through mechanisms other than their lipid-lowering effects.[102]
</p><h4>Diabetes mellitus</h4><p>Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of stroke by 2 to 3 times. While intensive blood sugar control has been shown to reduce small blood vessel complications such as kidney damage and damage to the retina of the eye it has not been shown to reduce large blood vessel complications such as stroke.[104][105]
</p><h4>Anticoagulation drugs</h4><p>Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin have been the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several studies have shown that aspirin and other antiplatelets are highly effective in secondary prevention after a stroke or transient ischemic attack.[69] Low doses of aspirin (for example 75–150 mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown.[106] Thienopyridines (clopidogrel, ticlopidine) might be slightly more effective than aspirin and have a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but are more expensive.[107] Both aspirin and clopidogrel may be useful in the first few weeks after a minor stroke or high risk TIA.[108] Clopidogrel has less side effects than ticlopidine.[107] Dipyridamole can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect.[109] Low-dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after having a myocardial infarction.[70]
</p><p>Those with atrial fibrillation have a 5% a year risk of stroke, and this risk is higher in those with valvular atrial fibrillation.[110] Depending on the stroke risk, anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin or aspirin is useful for prevention.[111] Except in people with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulants are not advised for stroke prevention—any benefit is offset by bleeding risk.[112]
</p><p>In primary prevention however, antiplatelet drugs did not reduce the risk of ischemic stroke but increased the risk of major bleeding.[113][114] Further studies are needed to investigate a possible protective effect of aspirin against ischemic stroke in women.[115][116]
</p><h4>Surgery</h4><p>Carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty can be used to remove atherosclerotic narrowing of the carotid artery. There is evidence supporting this procedure in selected cases.[89] Endarterectomy for a significant stenosis has been shown to be useful in preventing further strokes in those who have already had one.[117] Carotid artery stenting has not been shown to be equally useful.[118][119] People are selected for surgery based on age, gender, degree of stenosis, time since symptoms and the person's preferences.[89] Surgery is most efficient when not delayed too long—the risk of recurrent stroke in a patient who has a 50% or greater stenosis is up to 20% after 5 years, but endarterectomy reduces this risk to around 5%. The number of procedures needed to cure one patient was 5 for early surgery (within two weeks after the initial stroke), but 125 if delayed longer than 12 weeks.[120][121]
</p><p>Screening for carotid artery narrowing has not been shown to be a useful test in the general population.[122] Studies of surgical intervention for carotid artery stenosis without symptoms have shown only a small decrease in the risk of stroke.[123][124] To be beneficial, the complication rate of the surgery should be kept below 4%. Even then, for 100 surgeries, 5 patients will benefit by avoiding stroke, 3 will develop stroke despite surgery, 3 will develop stroke or die due to the surgery itself, and 89 will remain stroke-free but would also have done so without intervention.[89]
</p><h4>Diet</h4><p>Nutrition, specifically the Mediterranean-style diet, has the potential for decreasing the risk of having a stroke by more than half.[125] It does not appear that lowering levels of homocysteine with folic acid affects the risk of stroke.[126][127]
</p><h3>Women</h3><p>A number of specific recommendations have been made for women including taking aspirin after the 11th week of pregnancy if there is a history of previous chronic high blood pressure and taking blood pressure medications during pregnancy if the blood pressure is greater than 150 mmHg systolic or greater than 100 mmHg diastolic. In those who have previously had preeclampsia other risk factors should be treated more aggressively.[128]
</p><h3>Previous stroke or TIA</h3><p>Keeping blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg is recommended.[129] Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent ischemic strokes. Among people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%.[130] However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anticoagulation started early after an embolic stroke.[131] Stroke prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation is determined according to the CHA2DS2–VASc score. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the oral agent warfarin while a number of newer agents including dabigatran are alternatives which do not require prothrombin time monitoring.[129]
</p><p>Anticoagulants, when used following stroke, should not be stopped for dental procedures.[132]
</p><p>If studies show carotid artery stenosis, and the person has a degree of residual function on the affected side, carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of the stenosis) may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after stroke.
</p><h2>Management</h2><h3>Ischemic stroke</h3><p>Aspirin reduces the overall risk of recurrence by 13% with greater benefit early on.[133] Definitive therapy within the first few hours is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down (thrombolysis), or by removing it mechanically (thrombectomy). The philosophical premise underlying the importance of rapid stroke intervention was summed up as Time is Brain! in the early 1990s.[134] Years later, that same idea, that rapid cerebral blood flow restoration results in fewer brain cells dying, has been proved and quantified.[135]
</p><p>Tight blood sugar control in the first few hours does not improve outcomes and may cause harm.[136] High blood pressure is also not typically lowered as this has not been found to be helpful.[137][138] Cerebrolysin, a mix of pig brain tissue used to treat acute ischemic stroke in many Asian and European countries, does not improve outcomes and may increase the risk of severe adverse events.[139]
</p><h4>Thrombolysis</h4><p>Thrombolysis, such as with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), in acute ischemic stroke, when given within three hours of symptom onset results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to living without disability.[140][141] It does not, however, improve chances of survival.[140] Benefit is greater the earlier it is used.[140] Between three and four and a half hours the effects are less clear.[142][143][144] A 2014 review found a 5% increase in the number of people living without disability at three to six months; however, there was a 2% increased risk of death in the short term.[141] After four and a half hours thrombolysis worsens outcomes.[142] These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated.[145] There is no reliable way to determine who will have an intracranial bleed post-treatment versus who will not.[146]
</p><p>Its use is endorsed by the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms as long as there are no other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators[147] which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome. When administered within the first three hours thrombolysis improves functional outcome without affecting mortality.[148] 6.4% of people with large strokes developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus part of the reason for increased short term mortality.[149] Additionally, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine states that objective evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and applicability of tPA for acute ischemic stroke is insufficient to warrant its classification as standard of care.[150] Intra-arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.[151]
</p><h4>Endovascular treatment</h4><p>Mechanical removal of the blood clot causing the ischemic stroke, called mechanical thrombectomy, is a potential treatment for occlusion of a large artery, such as the middle cerebral artery. In 2015, one review demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this procedure if performed within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms.[152][153] It did not change the risk of death, but reduced disability compared to the use of intravenous thrombolysis which is generally used in people evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy.[154][155] Certain cases may benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.[156]
</p><h4>Craniectomy</h4><p>Strokes affecting large portions of the brain can cause significant brain swelling with secondary brain injury in surrounding tissue. This phenomenon is mainly encountered in strokes affecting brain tissue dependent upon the middle cerebral artery for blood supply and is also called ""malignant cerebral infarction"" because it carries a dismal prognosis. Relief of the pressure may be attempted with medication, but some require hemicraniectomy, the temporary surgical removal of the skull on one side of the head. This decreases the risk of death, although some people – who would otherwise have died – survive with disability.[157]
</p><h3>Hemorrhagic stroke</h3><p>People with intracerebral hemorrhage require supportive care, including blood pressure control if required. People are monitored for changes in the level of consciousness, and their blood sugar and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels. Anticoagulants and antithrombotics can make bleeding worse and are generally discontinued (and reversed if possible).[citation needed] A proportion may benefit from neurosurgical intervention to remove the blood and treat the underlying cause, but this depends on the location and the size of the hemorrhage as well as patient-related factors, and ongoing research is being conducted into the question as to which people with intracerebral hemorrhage may benefit.[158]
</p><p>In subarachnoid hemorrhage, early treatment for underlying cerebral aneurysms may reduce the risk of further hemorrhages. Depending on the site of the aneurysm this may be by surgery that involves opening the skull or endovascularly (through the blood vessels).[159]
</p><h3>Stroke unit</h3><p>Ideally, people who have had a stroke are admitted to a ""stroke unit"", a ward or dedicated area in a hospital staffed by nurses and therapists with experience in stroke treatment. It has been shown that people admitted to a stroke unit have a higher chance of surviving than those admitted elsewhere in hospital, even if they are being cared for by doctors without experience in stroke.[2][160]
</p><h3>Rehabilitation</h3><p>Stroke rehabilitation is the process by which those with disabling strokes undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living. It also aims to help the survivor understand and adapt to difficulties, prevent secondary complications and educate family members to play a supporting role.[citation needed]
</p><p>A rehabilitation team is usually multidisciplinary as it involves staff with different skills working together to help the patient. These include physicians trained in rehabilitation medicine, clinical pharmacists, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and orthotists. Some teams may also include psychologists and social workers, since at least one-third of affected people manifests post stroke depression. Validated instruments such as the Barthel scale may be used to assess the likelihood of a stroke patient being able to manage at home with or without support subsequent to discharge from a hospital.[citation needed]
</p><p>Good nursing care is fundamental in maintaining skin care, feeding, hydration, positioning, and monitoring vital signs such as temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Stroke rehabilitation begins almost immediately.
</p><p>For most people with stroke, physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) are the cornerstones of the rehabilitation process. Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved by the use of ankle foot orthoses.[161] PT and OT have overlapping areas of expertise; however, PT focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with patients to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and people's goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the patient relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes.[162] OT is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. Speech and language therapy is appropriate for people with the speech production disorders: dysarthria[163] and apraxia of speech,[164] aphasia,[165] cognitive-communication impairments, and problems with swallowing.
</p><p>Patients may have particular problems, such as dysphagia, which can cause swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a nasogastric tube may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely.
</p><p>Treatment of spasticity related to stroke often involves early mobilizations, commonly performed by a physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through various positionings.[36] Gaining initial improvement in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb.[36] After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb with the use of splints or other tools to stabilize the joint.[36] Cold in the form of ice wraps or ice packs have been proven to briefly reduce spasticity by temporarily dampening neural firing rates.[36] Electrical stimulation to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success.[36]
</p><p>Stroke rehabilitation should be started as quickly as possible and can last anywhere from a few days to over a year. Most return of function is seen in the first few months, and then improvement falls off with the ""window"" considered officially by U.S. state rehabilitation units and others to be closed after six months, with little chance of further improvement. However, patients have been known to continue to improve for years, regaining and strengthening abilities like writing, walking, running, and talking. Daily rehabilitation exercises should continue to be part of the stroke patient's routine. Complete recovery is unusual but not impossible and most patients will improve to some extent: proper diet and exercise are known to help the brain to recover.
</p><p>Some current and future therapy methods include the use of virtual reality and video games for rehabilitation. These forms of rehabilitation offer potential for motivating patients to perform specific therapy tasks that many other forms do not.[166] Many clinics and hospitals are adopting the use of these off-the-shelf devices for exercise, social interaction, and rehabilitation because they are affordable, accessible and can be used within the clinic and home.[166] Mirror therapy is associated with improved motor function of the upper extremity in patients with stroke.[167] Other non-invasive rehabilitation methods used to augment physical therapy of motor function in stroke patients include transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct-current stimulation.[168] and robotic therapies.[169]
</p><p>A stroke can also reduce people's general fitness.[170] Reduced fitness can reduce capacity for rehabilitation as well as general health.[171] Physical exercises as part of a rehabilitation program following a stroke appear safe.[170] Cardiorespiratory fitness training that involves walking in rehabilitation can improve speed, tolerance and independence during walking, and may improve balance.[170] There are inadequate long-term data about the effects of exercise and training on death, dependence and disability after a stroke.[170] The future areas of research may concentrate on the optimal exercise prescription and long term health benefits of exercise. The effect of physical training on cognition also may be studied further.
</p><p>The ability to walk independently in their community, indoors or outdoors, is important following stroke. Although no negative effects have been reported, it is unclear if outcomes can improve with these walking programs when compared to usual treatment.[172]
</p><h3>Self-management</h3><p>A stroke can affect the ability to live independently and with quality. Self-management programs are a special training that educates stroke survivors about stroke and its consequences, helps them acquire skills to cope with their challenges, and helps them set and meet their own goals during their recovery process. These programs are tailored to the target audience, and led by someone trained and expert in stroke and its consequences (most commonly professionals, but also stroke survivors and peers). A 2016 review reported that these programs improve the quality of life after stroke, without negative effects. People with stroke felt more empowered, happy and satisfied with life after participating in this training.[173]
</p><h2>Research</h2><h3>Angioplasty and stenting</h3><p>Angioplasty and stenting have begun to be looked at as possible viable options in treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Intra-cranial stenting in symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, the rate of technical success (reduction to stenosis of <50%) ranged from 90–98%, and the rate of major peri-procedural complications ranged from 4–10%.  The rates of restenosis and stroke following the treatment were also favorable. This data suggests that a randomized controlled trial is needed to more completely evaluate the possible therapeutic advantage of this preventative measure.[210]
</p><h3>Neuroprotection</h3><p>Neuroprotective agents including antioxidants which combat reactive oxygen species, or inhibit programmed cell death, or inhibit excitatory neurotransmitters have been shown experimentally to reduce tissue injury caused by ischemia. Until recently, human clinical trials with neuroprotective agents have failed, with the probable exception of deep barbiturate-induced coma. Disufenton sodium, the disulfonyl derivative of the radical-scavenging phenylbutylnitrone, was reported to be neuroprotective.[211] This agent is thought to work at the level of the blood vessel lining. However the favourable results evidenced from one large-scale trial were not reproduced in a second trial.[41] So that the benefit of disufenton sodium is questionable.[212]
</p><p>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been studied as a possible protective measure, but as of 2014, while the benefits of this have not been ruled out, further research is said to be needed.[213] Modulating microglial activation and polarization might mitigate hemorrhagic stroke injury and improve brain repair.[214]

4,acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div>Main article: Prevention of HIV/AIDS</div><div> AIDS Clinic, McLeod Ganj, Himachal Pradesh, India, 2010</div><h3>Sexual contact</h3><p>Consistent condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately 80% over the long term.[112] When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year.[113] There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection.[114] Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women.[115] By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.[116]
</p><p>Circumcision in Sub-Saharan Africa ""reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months"".[117] Due to these studies, both the World Health Organization and UNAIDS recommended male circumcision in 2007 as a method of preventing female-to-male HIV transmission in areas with high rates of HIV.[118] However, whether it protects against male-to-female transmission is disputed,[119][120] and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined.[121][122][123] The International Antiviral Society, however, does recommend it for all sexually active heterosexual males and that it be discussed as an option with men who have sex with men.[124] Some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may cause more sexual risk-taking behavior, thus negating its preventive effects.[125]
</p><p>Programs encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent HIV risk.[126] Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor.[127] Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior.[128][129] A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV.[130] Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive.[131] It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.[61]
</p><h3>Pre-exposure</h3><p>Antiretroviral treatment among people with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP).[132] TASP is associated with a 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk.[132][133] Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including men who have sex with men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.[115] It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100 person years.[134] The USPSTF, ini a 2018 draft, recommended PrEP in those who are at high risk.[135]
</p><p>Universal precautions within the health care environment are believed to be effective in decreasing the risk of HIV.[136] Intravenous drug use is an important risk factor and harm reduction strategies such as needle-exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk.[137][138]
</p><h3>Post-exposure</h3><p>A course of antiretrovirals administered within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions is referred to as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).[139] The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury.[139] As of 2013[update], the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.[140]
</p><p>PEP treatment is recommended after a sexual assault when the perpetrator is known to be HIV positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown.[141] The duration of treatment is usually four weeks[142] and is frequently associated with adverse effects—where zidovudine is used, about 70% of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).[49]
</p><h3>Mother-to-child</h3><div>Main article: HIV and pregnancy</div><p>Programs to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%.[78][137] This primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding.[78][143] If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case.[144] If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission.[145] In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.[146]
</p><h3>Vaccination</h3><div>Main article: HIV vaccine</div><p>Currently, there is no licensed vaccine for HIV or AIDS.[6] The most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009 and found a partial reduction in the risk of transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine.[147] Further trials of the RV 144 vaccine are ongoing.[148][149]
</p><h2>Treatment</h2><div>Main article: Management of HIV/AIDS</div><p>There is currently no cure or effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) which slows progression of the disease.[150] As of 2010[update] more than 6.6 million people were taking them in low and middle income countries.[151] Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections.
</p><h3>Antiviral therapy</h3><div> Stribild – a common once-daily ART regime consisting of elvitegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir and the booster cobicistat</div><p>Current HAART options are combinations (or ""cocktails"") consisting of at least three medications belonging to at least two types, or ""classes,"" of antiretroviral agents.[152] Initially treatment is typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).[153] Typical NRTIs include: zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC).[153] Combinations of agents which include protease inhibitors (PI) are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness.[152]
</p><p>The World Health Organization and United States recommends antiretrovirals in people of all ages including pregnant women as soon as the diagnosis is made regardless of CD4 count.[14][124][154] Once treatment is begun it is recommended that it is continued without breaks or ""holidays"".[29] Many people are diagnosed only after treatment ideally should have begun.[29] The desired outcome of treatment is a long term plasma HIV-RNA count below 50 copies/mL.[29] Levels to determine if treatment is effective are initially recommended after four weeks and once levels fall below 50 copies/mL checks every three to six months are typically adequate.[29] Inadequate control is deemed to be greater than 400 copies/mL.[29] Based on these criteria treatment is effective in more than 95% of people during the first year.[29]
</p><p>Benefits of treatment include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death.[155] In the developing world treatment also improves physical and mental health.[156] With treatment there is a 70% reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis.[152] Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mother-to-child transmission.[152][157] The effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance.[29] Reasons for non-adherence include poor access to medical care,[158] inadequate social supports, mental illness and drug abuse.[159] The complexity of treatment regimens (due to pill numbers and dosing frequency) and adverse effects may  reduce adherence.[160] Even though cost is an important issue with some medications,[161] 47% of those who needed them were taking them in low and middle income countries as of 2010[update][151] and the rate of adherence is similar in low-income and high-income countries.[162]
</p><p>Specific adverse events are related to the antiretroviral agent taken.[163] Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors.[25] Other common symptoms include diarrhea,[163][164] and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[165] Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects.[29] Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.[29]
</p><p>Treatment recommendations for children are somewhat different from those for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than 5 years of age; children above 5 are treated like adults.[166] The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100,000 copies/mL between one year and five years of age.[167]
</p><h3>Opportunistic infections</h3><p>Measures to prevent opportunistic infections are effective in many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals reduces the risk of developing additional opportunistic infections.[163] Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed.[168] Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection.[169] Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings.[170] It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200 cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP.[171] People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC.[172] Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997.[173] Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.[174][175]
</p><h3>Diet</h3><div>Main article: Nutrition and HIV/AIDS</div><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in HIV/AIDS.[176] A generally healthy diet is promoted. Dietary intake of micronutrients at RDA levels by HIV-infected adults is recommended by the WHO; higher intake of vitamin A, zinc, and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV positive adults, and is not recommended unless there is documented deficiency.[176][177][178][179] Dietary supplementation for people who are infected with HIV and who have inadequate nutrition or dietary deficiencies may strengthen their immune systems or help them recover from infections, however evidence indicating an overall benefit in morbidity or reduction in mortality is not consistent.[180]
</p><p>Evidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit.[181]  For pregnant and lactating women with HIV, multivitamin supplement improves outcomes for both mothers and children.[182]  If the pregnant or lactating mother has been advised to take anti-retroviral medication to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, multivitamin supplements should not replace these treatments.[182] There is some evidence that vitamin A supplementation in children with an HIV infection reduces mortality and improves growth.[183]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>In the US, approximately 60% of people with HIV use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine,[184] even though the effectiveness of most of these therapies has not been established.[185]  There is not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines.[186] There is insufficient evidence to recommend or support the use of medical cannabis to try to increase appetite or weight gain.[187]
</p><h2>Research</h2><div>Main article: HIV/AIDS research</div><p>HIV/AIDS research includes all medical research which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS along with fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.
</p><p>Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and circumcision and HIV. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, by tracking standard HIV indicators.[295] Use of common indicators is an increasing focus of development organizations and researchers.[296][297]

5,adenocarcinoma,"<h2>Brain Cancer Treatment Overview</h2><p>Treatment of brain cancer is usually complex. Most treatment plans involve several consulting doctors.</p><ul>
The team of doctors includes neurosurgeons (specialists in the brain and nervous system), oncologists, radiation oncologists (doctors who practice radiation therapy), and, of course, your primary health care provider. Your team may also include a dietitian, a social worker, a physical therapist, and, possibly, other specialists such as a neurologist.
The treatment protocols vary widely according to the location of the tumor, its size and type, your age, and any additional medical problems that you may have.
The most widely used treatments are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In most cases, more than one of these is used.
</ul><h2>Brain Cancer Surgery</h2><p>Many people with a brain tumor undergo surgery.</p><ul>
The purpose of surgery is to confirm that the abnormality seen during testing is indeed a tumor and to remove the tumor. If the tumor cannot be removed, the surgeon will take a sample of the tumor to identify its type.
In some cases, mostly in benign tumors, symptoms can be completely cured by surgical removal of the tumor. The neurosurgeon will attempt to remove all the tumor when possible.
</ul><p>You may undergo several treatments and procedures before surgery. For example:</p><ul>
You may be given a steroid drug, such as dexamethasone (Decadron), to relieve swelling.
You may be treated with an anticonvulsant drug to relieve or prevent seizures.
If you have excess cerebrospinal fluid collecting around the brain, a thin, plastic tube called a shunt may be placed to drain the fluid. One end of the shunt is placed in the cavity where fluid collects; the other end is threaded under your skin to another part of the body. The fluid drains from the brain to a site from which the fluid can be easily eliminated.
</ul><p>
</p><h2>New Brain Cancer Treatments</h2><p>New therapies for cancer are being developed all the time. When a therapy shows promise, it is studied in a lab and improved as much as possible. It is then tested in clinical trials involving people with cancer.</p><p>Through brain cancer clinical trials, researchers test the effects of new medications on a group of volunteers with brain cancer. Patients with brain cancer may be reluctant to take part in clinical trials for fear of getting no treatment at all for their brain cancer.</p><p>
</p><ul>
Clinical trials are available for virtually every kind of cancer.
The advantage of clinical trials is that they offer new therapies that may be more effective than existing therapies or have fewer side effects.
The disadvantage is that the therapy has not been proven to work or may not work in everyone.
Many people with cancer are eligible for participation in clinical trials.
To find out more, ask your oncologist. A list of clinical trials is available at the web site of the National Cancer Institute.

6,adhesion,"<h2>Adhesions Treatment - Self-Care at Home</h2><p>Adhesions must be diagnosed and treated by a physician.</p><h2>Medical Treatment</h2><p>Treatment varies depending on the location, extent of adhesion formation, and problems the adhesion is causing. Adhesions frequently improve without surgery. Therefore, unless a surgical emergency becomes evident, a doctor may treat symptoms rather than perform surgery.</p><h2>Surgery</h2><p>Two common surgical techniques used to treat abdominal adhesions are laparoscopy and laparotomy.</p><ul>
With laparoscopy, a doctor places a camera into your body through a small hole in the skin to confirm that adhesions exist. The adhesions then are cut and released (adhesiolysis).
</ul><ul>
In laparotomy, a doctor makes a larger incision to directly see adhesions and treat them. The technique varies depending on specific circumstances.
</ul><h2>Prevention</h2><p>Steps are taken during surgery to try and minimize the formation of adhesions. Some of these may include: shortening surgical time, keeping the tissues moist, gentle handling of any tissues or organs, and using starch –free and latex-free gloves. Several surgical products have also been developed to try to help prevent adhesions from forming during surgery. Film-like sheets are sometimes used between organs or body surfaces after large, open surgical procedures. </p>"
7,affect labile,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Education of patients, families, and caregivers is an important component of the appropriate treatment of PBA. Crying associated with PBA may be incorrectly interpreted as depression; laughter may be embarrassing. It is therefore critical for families and caregivers to recognize the pathological nature of PBA and the reassurance that this is an involuntary syndrome that is manageable.
Traditionally, antidepressants such as sertraline,[39] fluoxetine,[40] citalopram,[41] nortriptyline[42] and amitriptyline[43] have been prescribed with some efficacy.
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>Dextromethorphan hydrobromide affects the signals in the brain that trigger the cough reflex. It is generally used as a cough suppressant, although it can sometimes be used, medicinally, as a pain reliever, and is also used as a recreational drug.[44]
</p><p>Quinidine sulfate affects the way the heart beats, and is generally used in people with certain heart rhythm disorders. It is also used to treat malaria.[45] Quinidine sulfate, as a metabolic inhibitor, ""increases plasma levels of dextromethorphan by competitively inhibiting cytochrome P450 2D6, which catalyzes a major biotransformation pathway for dextromethorphan,"" enabling therapeutic dextromethorphan concentrations.[46]
</p><p>Dextromethorphan/quinidine is a combination of these two generic drugs, and is the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of PBA, approved on October 29, 2010.[47]
</p><p>For this multicenter study, the ""Objectives...[were] to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of two different doses of AVP-923 [Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination]...when compared to placebo.""[48] The conditions and results of that study are as follows:

""METHODS: In a 12-week randomized, double-blind trial, ALS and MS patients with clinically significant PBA"" were given a twice-daily dose of one of the following:

dextromethorphan hydrobromide 30 mg/quinidine sulfate 10 mg (N=110)
Nuedexta – dextromethorphan hydrobromide 20 mg/quinidine sulfate 10 mg (N=107)
283 patients (86.8%) completed the study. The number of PBA episodes (laughing and crying) were 47% and 49% lower (based on the trial's outcome measures), respectively, for the drug-combination options than for the placebo. The ""mean CNS-LS scores"" decreased by 8.2 points for both drug-combination options, vs a decrease of 5.7 points for the placebo.
Overall, the trial showed a statistically significant benefit from taking a combination of Dextromethorphan and quinidine, with both dosages being safe and well tolerated. For a secondary objective measuring a participant's ""perceived health status...measuring eight health concepts: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role-, emotional role-, social role functioning, and mental health,"" the higher dosage showed improvement, especially on measures of social functioning and mental health.[48][49]

8,anemia,"<h2>Treatments[edit]</h2><p>Treatments for anemia depend on cause and severity. Vitamin supplements given orally (folic acid or vitamin B12) or intramuscularly (vitamin B12) will replace specific deficiencies.[medical citation needed]
</p><h3>Oral iron[edit]</h3><p>Nutritional iron deficiency is common in developing nations. An estimated two-thirds of children and of women of childbearing age in most developing nations are estimated to suffer from iron
deficiency; one-third of them have the more severe form of the disorder, anemia.[63] Iron deficiency from nutritional causes is rare in men and postmenopausal women. The diagnosis of iron deficiency mandates a search for potential sources of loss, such as gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers or colon cancer. Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia is treated by oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, or ferrous gluconate.  When taking iron supplements, stomach upset or darkening of the feces are commonly experienced.  The stomach upset can be alleviated by taking the iron with food; however, this decreases the amount of iron absorbed.  Vitamin C aids in the body's ability to absorb iron, so taking oral iron supplements with orange juice is of benefit.[64] In anemias of chronic disease, associated with chemotherapy, or associated with renal disease, some clinicians prescribe recombinant erythropoietin or epoetin alfa, to stimulate RBC production, although since there is also concurrent iron deficiency and inflammation present, parenteral iron is advised to be taken concurrently.[65]
</p><h3>Injectable iron[edit]</h3><p>In cases where oral iron has either proven ineffective, would be too slow (for example, pre-operatively) or where absorption is impeded (for example in cases of inflammation), parenteral iron can be used. The body can absorb up to 6 mg iron daily from the gastrointestinal tract. In many cases the patient has a deficit of over 1,000 mg of iron which would require several months to replace. This can be given concurrently with erythropoietin to ensure sufficient iron for increased rates of erythropoiesis.[66]
</p><h3>Blood transfusions[edit]</h3><p>Blood transfusions in those without symptoms is not recommended until the hemoglobin is below 60 to 80 g/L (6 to 8 g/dL).[1] In those with coronary artery disease who are not actively bleeding transfusions are only recommended when the hemoglobin is below 70 to 80g/L (7 to 8 g/dL).[8] Transfusing earlier does not improve survival.[67] Transfusions otherwise should only be undertaken in cases of cardiovascular instability.[68]
</p><h3>Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent[edit]</h3><p>The motive for the administration of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) is to maintain hemoglobin at the lowest level that both minimizes transfusions and meets the individual person's needs.[69] They should not be used for mild or moderate anemia.[67] They are not recommended in people with chronic kidney disease unless hemoglobin levels are less than 10 g/dL or they have symptoms of anemia. Their use should be along with parenteral iron.[69][70]
</p><h3>Hyperbaric oxygen[edit]</h3><p>Treatment of exceptional blood loss (anemia) is recognized as an indication for hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.[71][72] The use of HBO is indicated when oxygen delivery to tissue is not sufficient in patients who cannot be given blood transfusions for medical or religious reasons. HBO may be used for medical reasons when threat of blood product incompatibility or concern for transmissible disease are factors.[71] The beliefs of some religions (ex: Jehovah's Witnesses) may require they use the HBO method.[71] A 2005 review of the use of HBO in severe anemia found all publications reported positive results.[73]
</p>"
9,anxiety state,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Focus is increasing on prevention of anxiety disorders.[83] There is tentative evidence to support the use of cognitive behavioral therapy[83] and mindfulness therapy.[84][85] As of 2013, there are no effective measures to prevent GAD in adults.[86]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment options include lifestyle changes, therapy, and medications. There is no clear evidence as to whether therapy or medication is more effective; the choice of which is up to the person with the anxiety disorder and most choose therapy first.[87] The other may be offered in addition to the first choice or if the first choice fails to relieve symptoms.[87]
</p><h3>Lifestyle and diet[edit]</h3><p>Lifestyle changes include exercise, for which there is moderate evidence for some improvement, regularizing sleep patterns, reducing caffeine intake, and stopping smoking.[87] Stopping smoking has benefits in anxiety as large as or larger than those of medications.[88] Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (such as fish oil) may reduce anxiety, particularly in those with more significant symptoms.[89]
</p><h3>Therapy[edit]</h3><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for anxiety disorders and is a first line treatment.[87][90][91][92][93] CBT appears to be equally effective when carried out via the internet.[93] While evidence for mental health apps is promising it is preliminary.[94]
</p><p>Self-help books can contribute to the treatment of people with anxiety disorders.[95]
</p><p>Mindfulness based programs also appear to be effective for managing anxiety disorders.[96][97] It is unclear if meditation has an effect on anxiety and transcendental meditation appears to be no different than other types of meditation.[98]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>Medications include SSRIs or SNRIs are first line choices for generalized anxiety disorder.[87][99] There is no good evidence for any member of the class being better than another, so cost often drives drug choice.[87][99] If they are effective, it is recommend that they be continued for at least a year.[100] Stopping these medications results in a greater risk of relapse.[101]
</p><p>Buspirone and pregabalin are second-line treatments for people who do not respond to SSRIs or SNRIs; there is also evidence that benzodiazepines including diazepam and clonazepam are effective but have fallen out of favor due to the risk of dependence and abuse.[87]
</p><p>Medications need to be used with care among older adults, who are more likely to have side effects because of coexisting physical disorders. Adherence problems are more likely among older people, who may have difficulty understanding, seeing, or remembering instructions.[8]
</p><p>In general medications are not seen as helpful in specific phobia but a benzodiazepine is sometimes used to help resolve acute episodes; as 2007 data were sparse for efficacy of any drug.[102]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><p>Many other remedies have been used for anxiety disorder. These include kava, where the potential for benefit seems greater than that for harm with short-term use in those with mild to moderate anxiety.[103][104] The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends use of kava for those with mild to moderate anxiety disorders who are not using alcohol or taking other medicines metabolized by the liver, and who wish to use ""natural"" remedies.[105] Side effects of kava in the clinical trials were rare and mild.
</p><p>Inositol has been found to have modest effects in people with panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.[106] There is insufficient evidence to support the use of St. John's wort, valerian or passionflower.[106]
</p><p>Aromatherapy has shown some tentative benefits for anxiety reduction in people with cancer when done with massages, although it not clear whether it could just enhance the effect of massage itself.[107]
</p><h3>Children[edit]</h3><p>Both therapy and a number of medications have been found to be useful for treating childhood anxiety disorders.[108] Therapy is generally preferred to medication.[109]
</p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a good first therapy approach.[109] Studies have gathered substantial evidence for treatments that are not CBT based as being effective forms of treatment, expanding treatment options for those who do not respond to CBT.[109] Like adults, children may undergo psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or counseling. Family therapy is a form of treatment in which the child meets with a therapist together with the primary guardians and siblings.[110] Each family member may attend individual therapy, but family therapy is typically a form of group therapy. Art and play therapy are also used. Art therapy is most commonly used when the child will not or cannot verbally communicate, due to trauma or a disability in which they are nonverbal. Participating in art activities allows the child to express what they otherwise may not be able to communicate to others.[111] In play therapy, the child is allowed to play however they please as a therapist observes them. The therapist may intercede from time to time with a question, comment, or suggestion. This is often most effective when the family of the child plays a role in the treatment.[110][112]
</p><p>If a medication option is warranted, antidepressants such as SSRIs and SNRIs can be effective.[108] Minor side effects with medications, however, are common.[108]
</p>"
10,aphasia,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Following are some precautions that should be taken to avoid aphasia, by decreasing the risk of stroke, the main cause of aphasia:
</p><ul>Exercising regularly
Eating a healthy diet
Keeping alcohol consumption low and avoiding tobacco use
Controlling blood pressure[54]</ul><h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>When addressing Wernicke's aphasia, according to Bakheit et al. (2007), the lack of awareness of the language impairments, a common characteristic of Wernicke's aphasia, may affect the rate and extent of therapy outcomes.[55] Klebic et al. (2011) suggests that people benefit from continuing therapy upon discharge from the hospital to ensure generalization.[53] Robey (1998) determined that at least 2 hours of treatment per week is recommended for making significant language gains.[52] Spontaneous recovery may cause some language gains, but without speech-language therapy, the outcomes can be half as strong as those with therapy.[52]
</p><p>When addressing Broca's aphasia, better outcomes occur when the person participates in therapy, and treatment is more effective than no treatment for people in the acute period.[52] Two or more hours of therapy per week in acute and post-acute stages produced the greatest results.[52] High-intensity therapy was most effective, and low-intensity therapy was almost equivalent to no therapy.[52]
</p><p>People with global aphasia are sometimes referred to as having irreversible aphasic syndrome, often making limited gains in auditory comprehension, and recovering no functional language modality with therapy. With this said, people with global aphasia may retain gestural communication skills that may enable success when communicating with conversational partners within familiar conditions. Process-oriented treatment options are limited, and people may not become competent language users as readers, listeners, writers, or speakers no matter how extensive therapy is.[32] However, people's daily routines and quality of life can be enhanced with reasonable and modest goals.[32]  After the first month, there is limited to no healing to language abilities of most people. There is a grim prognosis leaving 83% who were globally aphasic after the first month they will remain globally aphasic at the first year. Some people are so severely impaired that their existing process-oriented treatment approaches offer signs of progress, and therefore cannot justify the cost of therapy.[32]
</p><p>Perhaps due to the relative rareness of conduction aphasia, few studies have specifically studied the effectiveness of therapy for people with this type of aphasia. From the studies performed, results showed that therapy can help to improve specific language outcomes. One intervention that has had positive results is auditory repetition training. Kohn et al. (1990) reported that drilled auditory repetition training related to improvements in spontaneous speech, Francis et al. (2003) reported improvements in sentence comprehension, and Kalinyak-Fliszar et al. (2011) reported improvements in auditory-visual short-term memory.[56][57][58]
</p><p>Most acute cases of aphasia recover some or most skills by working with a speech-language pathologist. Recovery and improvement can continue for years after the stroke. After the onset of Aphasia, there is approximately a six-month period of spontaneous recovery; during this time, the brain is attempting to recover and repair the damaged neurons. Improvement varies widely, depending on the aphasia's cause, type, and severity. Recovery also depends on the person's age, health, motivation, handedness, and educational level.[14]
</p><p>There is no one treatment proven to be effective for all types of aphasias. The reason that there is no universal treatment for aphasia is because of the nature of the disorder and the various ways it is presented, as explained in the above sections. Aphasia is rarely exhibited identically, implying that treatment needs to be catered specifically to the individual. Studies have shown that, although there is no consistency on treatment methodology in literature, there is a strong indication that treatment, in general, has positive outcomes.[59] Therapy for aphasia ranges from increasing functional communication to improving speech accuracy, depending on the person's severity, needs and support of family and friends.[60] Group therapy allows individuals to work on their pragmatic and communication skills with other individuals with aphasia, which are skills that may not often be addressed in individual one-on-one therapy sessions. It can also help increase confidence and social skills in a comfortable setting.[61]
</p><p>Evidence does not support the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving aphasia after stroke.[62]
</p><p>Specific treatment techniques include the following:
</p><ul>Copy and recall therapy (CART) - repetition and recall of targeted words within therapy may strengthen orthographic representations and improve single word reading, writing, and naming[63]
Visual communication therapy (VIC) - the use of index cards with symbols to represent various components of speech
Visual action therapy (VAT) - typically treats individuals with global aphasia to train the use of hand gestures for specific items[64]
Functional communication treatment (FCT) - focuses on improving activities specific to functional tasks, social interaction, and self-expression
Promoting aphasic's communicative effectiveness (PACE) - a means of encouraging normal interaction between people with aphasia and clinicians. In this kind of therapy, the focus is on pragmatic communication rather than treatment itself. People are asked to communicate a given message to their therapists by means of drawing, making hand gestures or even pointing to an object[65]
Melodic intonation therapy (MIT) - aims to use the intact melodic/prosodic processing skills of the right hemisphere to help cue retrieval of words and expressive language[66]
Other - i.e. drawing as a way of communicating, trained conversation partners[59]</ul><p>Semantic feature analysis (SFA) -a type of aphasia treatment that targets word-finding deficits. It is based on the theory that neural connections can be strengthened by using related words and phrases that are similar to the target word, to eventually activate the target word in the brain.  SFA can be implemented in multiple forms such as verbally, written, using picture cards, etc.  The SLP provides prompting questions to the individual with aphasia in order for the person to name the picture provided.[67] Studies show that SFA is an effective intervention for improving confrontational naming.[68]
</p><p>Melodic intonation therapy is used to treat non-fluent aphasia and has proved to be effective in some cases.[69] However, there is still no evidence from randomized controlled trials confirming the efficacy of MIT in chronic aphasia. MIT is used to help people with aphasia vocalize themselves through speech song, which is then transferred as a spoken word. Good candidates for this therapy include people who have had left hemisphere strokes, non-fluent aphasias such as Broca's, good auditory comprehension, poor repetition and articulation, and good emotional stability and memory.[70] An alternative explanation is that the efficacy of MIT depends on neural circuits involved in the processing of rhythmicity and formulaic expressions (examples taken from the MIT manual: “I am fine,” “how are you?” or “thank you”); while rhythmic features associated with melodic intonation may engage primarily left-hemisphere subcortical areas of the brain, the use of formulaic expressions is known to be supported by right-hemisphere cortical and bilateral subcortical neural networks.[3][71]
</p><p>According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), involving family with the treatment of an aphasic loved one is ideal for all involved, because while it will no doubt assist in their recovery, it will also make it easier for members of the family to learn how best to communicate with them.[72]
</p><p>When a person's speech is insufficient, different kinds of augmentative and alternative communication could be considered such as alphabet boards, pictorial communication books, specialized software for computers or apps for tablets or smartphones.[73]
</p><h3>Intensity of treatment[edit]</h3><p>The intensity of aphasia therapy is determined by the length of each session, total hours of therapy per week, and total weeks of therapy provided. There is no consensus about what ""intense"" aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. A 2016 Cochrane review of speech and language therapy for people with aphasia found that treatments that are higher intensity, higher dose or over a long duration of time led to significantly better functional communication but people were more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).[74]
</p><p>Intensity of therapy is also dependent on the recency of stroke. People with aphasia react differently to intense treatment in the acute phase (0–3 months post stroke), sub-acute phase (3–6 months post stroke), or chronic phase (6+ months post stroke). Intensive therapy has been found to be effective for people with nonfluent and fluent chronic aphasia, but less effective for people with acute aphasia.[75]> People with sub-acute aphasia also respond well to intensive therapy of 100 hours over 62 weeks.  This suggests people in the sub-acute phase can improve greatly in language and functional communication measures with intensive therapy compared to regular therapy.[75]
</p><h3>Individualized service delivery[edit]</h3><p>Intensity of treatment should be individualized based on the recency of stroke, therapy goals, and other specific characteristics such as age, size of lesion, overall health status, and motivation.[75][76] Each individual reacts differently to treatment intensity and is able to tolerate treatment at different times post-stroke.[76]  Intensity of treatment after a stroke should be dependent on the person's motivation, stamina, and tolerance for therapy.[77]
</p><h2>Further research[edit]</h2><p>Research is currently being done using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to witness the difference in how language is processed in normal brains vs aphasic brains. This will help researchers to understand exactly what the brain must go through in order to recover from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and how different areas of the brain respond after such an injury.
</p><p>Another intriguing approach being tested is that of drug therapy. Research is in progress that will hopefully uncover whether or not certain drugs might be used in addition to speech-language therapy in order to facilitate recovery of proper language function. It's possible that the best treatment for Aphasia might involve combining drug treatment with therapy, instead of relying on one over the other.
</p><p>One other method being researched as a potential therapeutic combination with speech-language therapy is brain stimulation. One particular method, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), alters brain activity in whatever area it happens to stimulate, which has recently led scientists to wonder if this shift in brain function caused by TMS might help people re-learn languages.
</p><p>The research being put into Aphasia has only just begun. Researchers appear to have multiple ideas on how Aphasia could be more effectively treated in the future. ""Aphasia"". National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. 2015-08-18. Retrieved December 16, 2017.

11,arthritis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>There is no known cure for either rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. Treatment options vary depending on the type of arthritis and include physical therapy, lifestyle changes (including exercise and weight control), orthopedic bracing, and medications. Joint replacement surgery may be required in eroding forms of arthritis. Medications can help reduce inflammation in the joint which decreases pain. Moreover, by decreasing inflammation, the joint damage may be slowed.[citation needed]
</p><h3>Physical therapy[edit]</h3><p>In general, studies have shown that physical exercise of the affected joint can noticeably improve long-term pain relief. Furthermore, exercise of the arthritic joint is encouraged to maintain the health of the particular joint and the overall body of the person.[42]
</p><p>Individuals with arthritis can benefit from both physical and occupational therapy. In arthritis the joints become stiff and the range of movement can be limited. Physical therapy has been shown to significantly improve function, decrease pain, and delay need for surgical intervention in advanced cases.[43] Exercise prescribed by a physical therapist has been shown to be more effective than medications in treating osteoarthritis of the knee. Exercise often focuses on improving muscle strength, endurance and flexibility. In some cases, exercises may be designed to train balance. Occupational therapy can provide assistance with activities. Assistive technology is a tool used to aid a person's disability by reducing their physical barriers by improving the use of their damaged body part, typically after an amputation. Assistive technology devices can be customized to the patient or bought commercially.[44]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>There are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis. Treatment typically begins with medications that have the fewest side effects with further medications being added if insufficiently effective.[45]
</p><p>Depending on the type of arthritis, the medications that are given may be different. For example, the first-line treatment for osteoarthritis is acetaminophen (paracetamol) while for inflammatory arthritis it involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Opioids and NSAIDs are less well tolerated.[46]
</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is autoimmune so, in addition to pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs, is treated with another category of drug called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which act on the immune system to slow down the progression of RA. An example of this type of drug is methotrexate.
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>A number of rheumasurgical interventions have been incorporated in the treatment of arthritis since the 1950s. Arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee provides no additional benefit to optimized physical and medical therapy.[47]
</p><h3>Adaptive aids[edit]</h3><p>People with hand arthritis can have trouble with simple activities of daily living tasks (ADLs), such as turning a key in a lock or opening jars, as these activities can be cumbersome and painful. There are adaptive aids or (assistive devices (ADs)) available to help with these tasks,[48] but they are generally more costly than conventional products with the same function. It is now possible to 3-D print adaptive aids, which have been released as open source hardware to reduce patient costs.[49][50] Adaptive aids can significantly help arthritis patients and the vast majority of those with arthritis need and use them.[51]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><p>Further research is required to determine if transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for knee osteoarthritis is effective for controlling pain.[52]
</p><p>Low level laser therapy may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis.[53] Evidence of benefit is tentative.[54]
</p><p>Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis.[55] The FDA has not approved PEMF for the treatment of arthritis. In Canada, PEMF devices are legally licensed by Health Canada for the treatment of pain associated with arthritic conditions.[citation needed]
</p>"
12,asthma,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[124] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[125][126] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[124]
</p><p>Early pet exposure may be useful.[127] Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive[128] and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.[129]
</p><p>Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended.[129] Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.[111] It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affects the risk of exacerbations.[130] Immunization; however, is recommended by the World Health Organization.[131] Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.[132]
</p><h2>Management</h2><p>While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved.[133] A specific, customized plan for proactively monitoring and managing symptoms should be created. This plan should include the reduction of exposure to allergens, testing to assess the severity of symptoms, and the usage of medications. The treatment plan should be written down and advise adjustments to treatment according to changes in symptoms.[134]
</p><p>The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets, or aspirin, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended.  Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.[135][136]
</p><p>Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended. For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments.[7]
</p><p>People with asthma have higher rates of anxiety and depression.[137] This is associated with poorer asthma control.[137] Cognitive behavioral therapy may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma.[137]
</p><h3>Lifestyle modification</h3><p>Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include allergens, smoke (from tobacco or other sources), air pollution, non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods.[138][139] Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.[140] Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma.[141] Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms.[56] Overall, exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma.[142] Yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.[143]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.[135] Antibiotics are generally not needed for sudden worsening of symptoms.[144]
</p><h4>Fast–acting</h4><div> Salbutamol metered dose inhaler commonly used to treat asthma attacks.</div><ul>Short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (SABA), such as salbutamol (albuterol USAN) are the first line treatment for asthma symptoms.[7] They are recommended before exercise in those with exercise induced symptoms.[145]
Anticholinergic medications, such as ipratropium bromide, provide additional benefit when used in combination with SABA in those with moderate or severe symptoms.[7] Anticholinergic bronchodilators can also be used if a person cannot tolerate a SABA.[94] If a child requires admission to hospital additional ipratropium does not appear to help over a SABA.[146]
Older, less selective adrenergic agonists, such as inhaled epinephrine, have similar efficacy to SABAs.[147] They are however not recommended due to concerns regarding excessive cardiac stimulation.[148]</ul><h4>Long–term control</h4><div> Fluticasone propionate metered dose inhaler commonly used for long-term control.</div><ul>Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[135] Inhaled forms such as beclomethasone are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[135] It is usually recommended that inhaled formulations be used once or twice daily, depending on the severity of symptoms.[149]
Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[150][151] In children this benefit is uncertain.[150][152][151] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[153] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[154][155] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[156] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[156]
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[17][135][157][158] Evidence is insufficient to support use in acute exacerbations.[159][160]  For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[158] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[161]  In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids by the British Thoracic Society in 2009.[162] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[163] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[17][164] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[17]
Intravenous administration of the drug aminophylline does not provide an improvement in bronchodilation when compared to standard inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[165] Aminophylline treatment is associated with more adverse effects compared to inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[165]
Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are another non-preferred alternative to corticosteroids.[135]
For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[166] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[167] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[167] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[167]</ul><h4>Delivery methods</h4><p>Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[168] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[169]
</p><h4>Adverse effects</h4><p>Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[170] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[170][171][172] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[173]
</p><h3>Others</h3><p>When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. For emergency management other options include:
</p><ul>Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.[174]
Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone.[175] One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.[176]
Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks.[18][177][178] In adults it results in a reduction of hospital admissions.[179]
Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.[18]
Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.[174]
Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.[174] Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.[180]
The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.[181]
For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[182] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[182][183] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.[184]
Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[185]
Omalizumab may also be useful in those with poorly controlled allergic asthma.[186]
It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[187]</ul><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[188][189] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.  Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C.[190] There is tentative support for its use in exercise induced bronchospasm.[191] In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation is likely to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations.[192]
</p><p>Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[193][194] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[195]
</p><p>Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[196]  The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[136]  Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[193]

13,bacteremia,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The presence of bacteria in the blood almost always requires treatment with antibiotics. This is because there are high mortality rates from progression to sepsis if antibiotics are delayed.[23]
</p><p>The treatment of bacteremia should begin with empiric antibiotic coverage.  Any patient presenting with signs or symptoms of bacteremia or a positive blood culture should be started on intravenous antibiotics.[20] The choice of antibiotic is determined by the most likely source of infection and by the characteristic organisms that typically cause that infection.  Other important considerations include the patient's past history of antibiotic use, the severity of the presenting symptoms, and any allergies to antibiotics.[40]  Empiric antibiotics should be narrowed, preferably to a single antibiotic, once the blood culture returns with a particular bacteria that has been isolated.[40]
</p><h3>Gram positive bacteremia[edit]</h3><p>The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends treating uncomplicated methicillin resistant staph aureus (MRSA) bacteremia with a 14-day course of intravenous vancomycin.[41]  Uncomplicated bacteremia is defined as having positive blood cultures for MRSA, but having no evidence of endocarditis, no implanted prostheses, negative blood cultures after 2–4 days of treatment, and signs of clinical improvement after 72 hrs.[41]
</p><p>The antibiotic treatment of choice for streptococcal and enteroccal infections differs by species.  However, it is important to look at the antibiotic resistance pattern for each species from the blood culture to better treat infections caused by resistant organisms.[10]
</p><h3>Gram negative bacteremia[edit]</h3><p>The treatment of gram negative bacteremia is also highly dependent on the causative organism.  Empiric antibiotic therapy should be guided by the most likely source of infection and the patient's past exposure to healthcare facilities.[42]  In particular, a recent history of exposure to a healthcare setting may necessitate the need for antibiotics with pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage or broader coverage for resistant organisms.[42]  Extended generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone or beta lactam/beta lactam inhibitor antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam are frequently used for the treatment of gram negative bacteremia.[42]
</p><h3>Catheter-associated infections[edit]</h3><p>For healthcare-associated bacteremia due to intravenous catheters, the IDSA has published guidelines for catheter removal.  Short term catheters (in place <14 days) should be removed if bacteremia is caused by any gram negative bacteria, staph aureus, enterococci or mycobacteria.[43]  Long term catheters (>14 days) should be removed if the patient is developing signs or symptoms of sepsis or endocarditis, or if blood cultures remain positive for more than 72 hours.[43]

14,benign prostatic hypertrophy,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><p>Lifestyle alterations to address the symptoms of BPH include physical activity,[39] decreasing fluid intake before bedtime, moderating the consumption of alcohol and caffeine-containing products and following a timed voiding schedule. Patients can also attempt to avoid products and medications with anticholinergic properties that may exacerbate urinary retention symptoms of BPH, including antihistamines, decongestants, opioids, and tricyclic antidepressants; however, changes in medications should be done with input from a medical professional.[40]
</p><h4>Voiding position[edit]</h4><p>Voiding position when urinating may influence urodynamic parameters (urinary flow rate, voiding time, and post-void residual volume).[41] A meta-analysis found no differences between the standing and sitting positions for healthy males, but that, for elderly males with lower urinary tract symptoms, voiding in the sitting position:[42]
</p><ul>decreased the post void residual volume
increased the maximum urinary flow, comparable with pharmacological intervention
decreased the voiding time</ul><p>This urodynamic profile is associated with a lower risk of urologic complications, such as cystitis and bladder stones.
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>The two main medication classes for BPH management are alpha blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors.[43]
</p><h4>Alpha blockers[edit]</h4><p>Selective α1-blockers are the most common choice for initial therapy.[44][45][46] They include alfuzosin,[47][48] doxazosin,[49] silodosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin. They have a small to moderate benefit.[50] All five are equally effective but have slightly different side effect profiles.[51] Alpha blockers relax smooth muscle in the prostate and the bladder neck, thus decreasing the blockage of urine flow. Common side effects of alpha blockers include orthostatic hypotension (a head rush or dizzy spell when standing up or stretching), ejaculation changes, erectile dysfunction,[52] headaches, nasal congestion, and weakness.
</p><p>Tamsulosin and silodosin are selective α1 receptor blockers that preferentially bind to the α1A receptor in the prostate instead of the α1B receptor in the blood vessels. Less-selective α1 receptor blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may lower blood pressure. The older, less selective α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin is not a first line choice for either high blood pressure or prostatic hyperplasia; it is a choice for patients who present with both problems at the same time. The older, broadly non-selective alpha blocker medications such as phenoxybenzamine are not recommended for control of BPH.[53] Non-selective alpha blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may also require slow dose adjustments as they can lower blood pressure and cause syncope (fainting) if the response to the medication is too strong.
</p><h4>5α-Reductase inhibitors[edit]</h4><p>The 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride may also be used in men with BPH.[54] These medications inhibit the 5α-reductase enzyme, which, in turn, inhibits production of DHT, a hormone responsible for enlarging the prostate. Effects may take longer to appear than alpha blockers, but they persist for many years.[55] When used together with alpha blockers, no benefit was reported in short-term trials, but in a longer term study (3–4 years) there was a greater reduction in BPH progression to acute urinary retention and surgery than with either agent alone, especially in people with more severe symptoms and larger prostates.[56][57][58] Other trials have confirmed reductions in symptoms, within 6 months in one trial, an effect that was maintained after withdrawal of the alpha blocker.[57][59] Side effects include decreased libido and ejaculatory or erectile dysfunction.[60][61] The 5α-reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant women because of their teratogenicity due to interference with fetal testosterone metabolism, and as a precaution, pregnant women should not handle crushed or broken tablets.[62]
</p><h4>Others[edit]</h4><p>Antimuscarinics such as tolterodine may also be used, especially in combination with alpha blockers.[63] They act by decreasing acetylcholine effects on the smooth muscle of the bladder, thus helping control symptoms of an overactive bladder.[64]
</p><p>Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil citrate show some symptomatic relief, suggesting a possible common cause with erectile dysfunction.[65] Tadalafil was considered then rejected by NICE in the UK for the treatment of symptoms associated with BPH.[66] In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tadalafil to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and for the treatment of BPH and erectile dysfunction (ED), when the conditions occur simultaneously.[67]
</p><h3>Self-catheterization[edit]</h3><p>Intermittent urinary catheterization is used to relieve the bladder in people with urinary retention. Self-catheterization is an option in BPH when it is difficult or impossible to completely empty the bladder.[68] Urinary tract infection is the most common complication of intermittent catheterization.[69] Several techniques and types of catheter are available, including sterile (single-use) and clean (multiple use) catheters, but, based on current information, none is superior to others in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infection.[70]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia</div><div> Prostate with a large median lobe bulging upwards. A metal instrument is placed in the urethra (which passes through the prostate). This specimen was almost 7 centimeters long with a volume of about 60 cubic centimeters on transrectal ultrasound and was removed during a Hryntschak procedure or transvesical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate through the bladder) for benign prostatic hyperplasia.</div><p>If medical treatment is not effective a person may try office-based therapies or transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), surgery may need to be performed. Surgical techniques used include the following:
</p><ul>Open prostatectomy: not usually performed nowadays, even if results are very good.
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): the gold standard.
Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP): rarely performed; the technique is similar to TURP but less definitive.
Photoselective (laser) vaporization of the prostate (PVP): common treatment.</ul><h3>Endovascular[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Prostatic artery embolization</div><p>The latest alternative to surgical treatment is arterial embolization, an endovascular procedure performed in interventional radiology.[71] Through catheters, embolic agents are released in the main branches of the prostatic artery, in order to induce a decrease in the size of the prostate gland, thus reducing the urinary symptoms.[72]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><p>While herbal remedies are commonly used, a 2016 review found them to be no better than placebo.[73] Saw palmetto extract from Serenoa repens, while one of the most commonly used, is no better than placebo in both symptom relief and decreasing prostate size.[74][75][76] Other herbal medicines include beta-sitosterol[77] from Hypoxis rooperi (African star grass) and pygeum (extracted from the bark of Prunus africana),[78] while there is less substantial support for the efficacy of pumpkin seed (Cucurbita pepo) and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) root.[79] A systematic review of Chinese herbal medicines found that the quality of studies was insufficient to indicate any superiority over Western medicines.[80]

15,biliary calculus,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Maintaining a healthy weight by getting sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet that is high in fiber may help prevent gallstone formation.[2]
</p><p>The medication ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) appears to prevent formation of gallstones during weight loss.[35] A high fat diet during weight loss also appears to prevent gallstones.[35]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><h3>Surgical[edit]</h3><p>Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) has a 99% chance of eliminating the recurrence of cholelithiasis. The lack of a gallbladder may have no negative consequences in many people. However, there is a portion of the population—between 10 and 15%—who develop a condition called postcholecystectomy syndrome[36] which may cause gastrointestinal distress and persistent pain in the upper-right abdomen, as well as a 10% risk of developing chronic diarrhea.[37]
</p><p>There are two surgical options for cholecystectomy:
</p><ul>Open cholecystectomy is performed via an abdominal incision (laparotomy) below the lower right ribs. Recovery typically requires 3–5 days of hospitalization, with a return to normal diet a week after release and to normal activity several weeks after release.[11]
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, introduced in the 1980s, is performed via three to four small puncture holes for a camera and instruments.  Post-operative care typically includes a same-day release or a one night hospital stay, followed by a few days of home rest and pain medication.[11]</ul><h3>Medical[edit]</h3><p>Cholesterol gallstones can sometimes be dissolved with ursodeoxycholic acid taken by mouth, but it may be necessary for the person to take this medication for years.[38] Gallstones may recur, however, once the drug is stopped. Obstruction of the common bile duct with gallstones can sometimes be relieved by endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy (ERS) following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).[38]
</p>"
16,bipolar disorder,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>Attempts at prevention of bipolar disorder have focused on stress (such as childhood adversity or highly conflictual families) which, although not a diagnostically specific causal agent for bipolar, does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness.[107] There has been debate regarding the causal relationship between usage of cannabis and bipolar disorder.[108]
</p><h2>Management</h2><div>Main article: Treatment of bipolar disorder</div><p>There are a number of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic techniques used to treat bipolar disorder. Individuals may use self-help and pursue recovery.
</p><p>Hospitalization may be required especially with the manic episodes present in bipolar I. This can be voluntary or (local legislation permitting) involuntary (called civil or involuntary commitment). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to deinstitutionalization, although these can still occur.[109] Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or an Assertive Community Treatment team, supported employment and patient-led support groups, intensive outpatient programs. These are sometimes referred to as partial-inpatient programs.[110]
</p><h3>Psychosocial</h3><p>Psychotherapy is aimed at alleviating core symptoms, recognizing episode triggers, reducing negative expressed emotion in relationships, recognizing prodromal symptoms before full-blown recurrence, and, practicing the factors that lead to maintenance of remission.[111][112][113] Cognitive behavioral therapy, family-focused therapy, and psychoeducation have the most evidence for efficacy in regard to relapse prevention, while interpersonal and social rhythm therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy appear the most effective in regard to residual depressive symptoms. Most studies have been based only on bipolar I, however, and treatment during the acute phase can be a particular challenge.[114] Some clinicians emphasize the need to talk with individuals experiencing mania, to develop a therapeutic alliance in support of recovery.[115]
</p><h3>Medication</h3><div> Lithium is often used to treat bipolar disorder and has the best evidence for reducing suicide.</div><p>A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder.[59] The medication with the best evidence is lithium, which is an effective treatment for acute manic episodes, preventing relapses, and bipolar depression.[116] Lithium reduces the risk of suicide, self-harm, and death in people with bipolar disorder.[117] It is unclear if ketamine (a common general anaesthetic used in surgery) is useful in bipolar as of 2015[update].[118]
</p><h4>Mood stabilizers</h4><p>Lithium and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproic acid are used as mood stabilizers to treat bipolar disorder. These mood stabilizers are used for long-term mood stabilization but have not demonstrated the ability to quickly treat acute bipolar depression.[119] Lithium is preferred for long-term mood stabilization.[59] Carbamazepine effectively treats manic episodes, with some evidence it has greater benefit in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, or those with more psychotic symptoms or a more schizoaffective clinical picture. It is less effective in preventing relapse than lithium or valproate.[120][121] Valproate has become a commonly prescribed treatment and effectively treats manic episodes.[122] Lamotrigine has some efficacy in treating bipolar depression, and this benefit is greatest in more severe depression.[123] It has also been shown to have some benefit in preventing bipolar disorder relapses, though there are concerns about the studies done, and is of no benefit in rapid cycling subtype of bipolar disorder.[124] The effectiveness of topiramate is unknown.[125]
</p><h4>Antipsychotics</h4><p>Antipsychotic medications are effective for short-term treatment of bipolar manic episodes and appear to be superior to lithium and anticonvulsants for this purpose.[59] Atypical antipsychotics are also indicated for bipolar depression refractory to treatment with mood stabilizers.[119] Olanzapine is effective in preventing relapses, although the supporting evidence is weaker than the evidence for lithium.[126]
</p><h4>Antidepressants</h4><p>Antidepressants are not recommended for use alone in the treatment of bipolar disorder and have not been found to be of any benefit over that found with mood stabilizers.[11][127] Atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., aripiprazole) are preferred over antidepressants to augment the effects of mood stabilizers due to the lack of efficacy of antidepressants in bipolar disorder.[119]
</p><h4>Other</h4><p>Short courses of benzodiazepines may be used in addition to other medications until mood stabilizing become effective.[128] Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective form of treatment for acute mood disturbances in those with bipolar disorder, especially when psychotic or catatonic features are displayed.[11] ECT is also recommended for use in pregnant women with bipolar disorder.[11]
</p><p>Contrary to widely held views, stimulants are relatively safe in bipolar disorder, and considerable evidence suggests they may even produce an antimanic effect. In cases of comorbid ADHD and bipolar, stimulants may help improve both conditions.[129]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>Several studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may have beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, but not manic symptoms. However, only a few small studies of variable quality have been published and there is not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions.[130][131]

17,bronchitis,"<h2>What Are the Treatments?</h2><p>Most of the time, bronchitis goes away on its own within a couple of weeks.</p><p>If yours is caused by bacteria (which is rare), your doctor may give you antibiotics.</p><p>If you have asthma, allergies, or you’re wheezing, she might suggest an inhaler. This helps open up your airways and makes it easier to breathe.</p><p>To ease your symptoms, you can:</p><ul>

Drink a lot of water. Eight to 12 glasses a day helps thin out your mucus and makes it easier to cough it up.

Get plenty of rest.


Take over-the-counter pain relievers.
Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin help with pain. But avoid giving aspirin to children. You can use acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help with both pain and fever.

Use a humidifier or try steam. A hot shower can be great for loosening up the mucus.

Take over-the-counter cough medicines. You might take an expectorant (like guaifenosin) during the day to loosen your mucous so it's easier to cough out. For children, check with your pediatrician before using any cough syrups.
</ul><p> </p><h2>Can It Be Prevented?</h2><p>Here are some ways to lower your chances of getting bronchitis:

</p><ul>
Avoid cigarette smoke.
Get the flu vaccine, since you might get bronchitis from the flu virus.
Make sure your pertussis vaccine is up to date.

Wash your hands often.
Wear a mask when you’re around things that bother your lungs, such as paint fumes.
</ul><p> </p>"
18,candidiasis,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>A diet that supports the immune system and is not high in simple carbohydrates contributes to a healthy balance of the oral and intestinal flora.[34][41] While yeast infections are associated with diabetes, the level of blood sugar control may not affect the risk.[55] Wearing cotton underwear may help to reduce the risk of developing skin and vaginal yeast infections, along with not wearing wet clothes for long periods of time.[10][36]
</p><p>Oral hygiene can help prevent oral candidiasis when people have a weakened immune system.[4] For people undergoing cancer treatment, chlorhexidine mouthwash can prevent or reduce thrush.[4] People who use inhaled corticosteroids can reduce the risk of developing oral candidiasis by rinsing the mouth with water or mouthwash after using the inhaler.[4]
</p><p>For women who experience recurrent yeast infections, there is limited evidence that oral or intravaginal probiotics help to prevent future infections.[12][56] This includes either as pills or as yogurt.[12]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medications; these include clotrimazole, nystatin, fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B, and echinocandins.[15]  Intravenous fluconazole or an intravenous echinocandin such as caspofungin are commonly used to treat immunocompromised or critically ill individuals.[15]
</p><p>The 2016 revision of the clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis lists a large number of specific treatment regimens for Candida infections that involve different Candida species, forms of antifungal drug resistance, immune statuses, and infection localization and severity.[15] Gastrointestinal candidiasis in immunocompetent individuals is treated with 100–200 mg fluconazole per day for 2–3 weeks.[23]
</p><h3>Localized infection[edit]</h3><p>Mouth and throat candidiasis are treated with antifungal medication. Oral candidiasis usually responds to topical treatments; otherwise, systemic antifungal medication may be needed for oral infections. Candidal skin infections in the skin folds (candidal intertrigo) typically respond well to topical antifungal treatments (e.g., nystatin or miconazole). Systemic treatment with antifungals by mouth is reserved for severe cases or if treatment with topical therapy is unsuccessful. Candida esophagitis may be treated orally or intravenously; for severe or azole-resistant esophageal candidiasis, treatment with amphotericin B may be necessary.[5]
</p><p>Vaginal yeast infections are typically treated with topical antifungal agents.[15] A one-time dose of fluconazole is 90% effective in treating a vaginal yeast infection.[57] For severe nonrecurring cases, several doses of fluconazole is recommended.[15] Local treatment may include vaginal suppositories or medicated douches. Other types of yeast infections require different dosing. Gentian violet can be used for thrush in breastfeeding babies. C. albicans can develop resistance to fluconazole, this being more of an issue in those with HIV/AIDS who are often treated with multiple courses of fluconazole for recurrent oral infections.[58]
</p><p>For vaginal yeast infection in pregnancy, topical imidazole or triazole antifungals are considered the therapy of choice owing to available safety data.[59] Systemic absorption of these topical formulations is minimal, posing little risk of transplacental transfer.[59] In vaginal yeast infection in pregnancy, treatment with topical azole antifungals is recommended for 7 days instead of a shorter duration.[59]
</p><p>No benefit from probiotics has been found for active infections.[13]
</p><h3>Blood infection[edit]</h3><p>Systemic candidiasis occurs when Candida yeast enters the bloodstream and may spread (becoming disseminated candidiasis) to other organs, including the central nervous system, kidneys, liver, bones, muscles, joints, spleen, or eyes. Treatment typically consists of oral or intravenous antifungal medications.[60] In candidal infections of the blood, intravenous fluconazole or an echinocandin such as caspofungin may be used.[15] Amphotericin B is another option.[15]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>High level Candida colonization is linked to several diseases of the gastrointestinal tract including Crohn's disease.[74][75]
</p><p>There has been an increase in resistance to antifungals worldwide over the past 30–40 years.[76][77]
</p>"
19,carcinoma,"<h2>Treatments</h2><p>Squamous cell carcinoma can usually be treated with minor surgery that can be done in a doctor’s office or hospital clinic. Depending on the size and location of the SCC, your doctor may choose to use any of the following techniques to remove it:</p><ul>
Excision: cutting out the cancer spot and some healthy skin around it, then stitching up the wound
Surgery using a small hand tool and an electronic needle to kill cancer cells
Mohs surgery: excision and then inspecting the excised skin using a microscope; this requires stitching up the wound
Lymph node surgery: remove a piece of the lymph node; uses general anesthesia

Dermabrasion: ""sanding"" your affected area of skin with a tool to make way for a new layer
Cryosurgery: freezing of the spot using liquid nitrogen
Topical chemotherapy: a gel or cream applied to the skin, sometimes with microneedling
Targeted drug treatment
Photodynamic therapy (a photosensitizing solution applied to your skin then activated with a light or daylight, or sometimes with intense pulsed light)
Ablative and nonablative lasers, or chemical peels
Superficial radiation therapy

20,carcinoma breast,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><p>Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[89] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil and 20% in China.[89] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking  are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[89][90] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[91] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[28]
</p><p>High intake of citrus fruit has been associated with a 10% reduction in the risk of breast cancer.[92]
</p><p>Marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids appear to reduce the risk.[93] High consumption of soy-based foods may reduce risk.[94]
</p><h3>Pre-emptive surgery[edit]</h3><p>Removal of both breasts before any cancer has been diagnosed or any suspicious lump or other lesion has appeared (a procedure known as ""prophylactic bilateral mastectomy"" or ""risk reducing mastectomy"") may be considered in people with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which are associated with a substantially heightened risk for an eventual diagnosis of breast cancer.[95][96] Evidence is not strong enough to support this procedure in anyone but those at the highest risk.[97] BRCA testing is recommended in those with a high family risk after genetic counseling. It is not recommended routinely.[98]  This is because there are many forms of changes in BRCA genes, ranging from harmless polymorphisms to obviously dangerous frameshift mutations.[99]The effect of most of the identifiable changes in the genes is uncertain. Testing in an average-risk person is particularly likely to return one of these indeterminate, useless results. Removing the second breast in a person who has breast cancer (contralateral risk‐reducing mastectomy or CRRM) may reduce the risk of cancer in the second breast, however, it is unclear if removing the second breast in those who have breast cancer improves survival.[97]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>The selective estrogen receptor modulators (such as tamoxifen) reduce the risk of breast cancer but increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial cancer.[100] There is no overall change in the risk of death.[100][101] They are thus not recommended for the prevention of breast cancer in women at average risk but may be offered for those at high risk.[102] The benefit of breast cancer reduction continues for at least five years after stopping a course of treatment with these medications.[103]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Breast cancer management</div><p>The management of breast cancer depends on various factors, including the stage of the cancer and the person's age. Treatments are more aggressive when the cancer is more advanced or there is a higher risk of recurrence of the cancer following treatment.
</p><p>Breast cancer is usually treated with surgery, which may be followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both. A multidisciplinary approach is preferable.[114] Hormone receptor-positive cancers are often treated with hormone-blocking therapy over courses of several years. Monoclonal antibodies, or other immune-modulating treatments, may be administered in certain cases of metastatic and other advanced stages of breast cancer. Although this range of treatment is still being studied.[115]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><div> Chest after right breast mastectomy</div><p>Surgery involves the physical removal of the tumor, typically along with some of the surrounding tissue. One or more lymph nodes may be biopsied during the surgery; increasingly the lymph node sampling is performed by a sentinel lymph node biopsy.
</p><p>Standard surgeries include:
</p><ul>Mastectomy: Removal of the whole breast.
Quadrantectomy: Removal of one-quarter of the breast.
Lumpectomy: Removal of a small part of the breast.</ul><p>Once the tumor has been removed, if the person desires, breast reconstruction surgery, a type of plastic surgery, may then be performed to improve the aesthetic appearance of the treated site.
Alternatively, women use breast prostheses to simulate a breast under clothing, or choose a flat chest. Nipple prosthesis can be used at any time following the mastectomy.
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>Medications used after and in addition to surgery are called adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy or other types of therapy prior to surgery are called neoadjuvant therapy. Aspirin may reduce mortality from breast cancer when used with other treatments.[116][117]
</p><p>There are currently three main groups of medications used for adjuvant breast cancer treatment:  hormone-blocking agents, chemotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies.
</p><p>Hormone blocking therapy
</p><dl>Some breast cancers require estrogen to continue growing. They can be identified by the presence of estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) on their surface (sometimes referred to together as hormone receptors). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that either block the receptors, e.g. tamoxifen, or alternatively block the production of estrogen with an aromatase inhibitor, e.g. anastrozole[118] or letrozole. The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years.[119] Letrozole is recommended for 5 years.  Aromatase inhibitors are only suitable for women after menopause; however, in this group, they appear better than tamoxifen.[120] This is because the active aromatase in postmenopausal women is different from the prevalent form in premenopausal women, and therefore these agents are ineffective in inhibiting the predominant aromatase of premenopausal women.[121] Aromatase inhibitors should not be given to premenopausal women with intact ovarian function (unless they are also on treatment to stop their ovaries from working).[122] CDK inhibitors can be used in combination with endocrine or aromatase therapy.[123]</dl><p>Chemotherapy
</p><dl>Chemotherapy is predominantly used for cases of breast cancer in stages 2–4, and is particularly beneficial in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease. The chemotherapy medications are administered in combinations, usually for periods of 3–6 months. One of the most common regimens, known as ""AC"",  combines cyclophosphamide with doxorubicin. Sometimes a taxane drug, such as docetaxel, is added, and the regime is then known as ""CAT"". Another common treatment is cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (or ""CMF""). Most chemotherapy medications work by destroying fast-growing and/or fast-replicating cancer cells, either by causing DNA damage upon replication or by other mechanisms. However, the medications also damage fast-growing normal cells, which may cause serious side effects. Damage to the heart muscle is the most dangerous complication of doxorubicin, for example.</dl><p>Monoclonal antibodies
</p><dl>Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody to HER2, has improved the 5-year disease free survival of stage 1–3 HER2-positive breast cancers to about 87% (overall survival 95%).[124] Between 25% and 30% of breast cancers overexpress the HER2 gene or its protein product,[125] and overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer is associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. Trastuzumab, however, is very expensive, and its use may cause serious side effects (approximately 2% of people who receive it develop significant heart damage).[126] Another antibody pertuzumab prevents HER2 dimerization and is recommended together with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in severe disease.[127] [128]</dl><h3>Radiation[edit]</h3><div> Internal radiotherapy for breast cancer</div><p>Radiotherapy is given after surgery to the region of the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes, to destroy microscopic tumor cells that may have escaped surgery. It may also have a beneficial effect on tumor microenvironment.[129][130] Radiation therapy can be delivered as external beam radiotherapy or as brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy). Conventionally radiotherapy is given after the operation for breast cancer.  Radiation can also be given at the time of operation on the breast cancer. Radiation can reduce the risk of recurrence by 50–66% (1/2 – 2/3 reduction of risk) when delivered in the correct dose[131] and is considered essential when breast cancer is treated by removing only the lump (Lumpectomy or Wide local excision).
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Treatments are being evaluated in trials. This includes individual drugs, combinations of drugs, and surgical and radiation techniques  Investigations include new types of targeted therapy,[188] cancer vaccines, oncolytic virotherapy,[189] gene therapy[190][191] and immunotherapy.[192]
</p><p>The latest research is reported annually at scientific meetings such as that of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium,[193] and the St. Gallen Oncology Conference in St. Gallen, Switzerland.[194] These studies are reviewed by professional societies and other organizations, and formulated into guidelines for specific treatment groups and risk category.
</p><p>Fenretinide, a retinoid, is also being studied as a way to reduce the risk of breast cancer (retinoids are medications related to vitamin A).[195][196]
</p><h3>Cryoablation[edit]</h3><p>As of 2014 cryoablation is being studied to see if it could be a substitute for a lumpectomy in small cancers.[197] There is tentative evidence in those with tumors less than 2 centimeters.[198] It may also be used in those in who surgery is not possible.[198] Another review states that cryoablation looks promising for early breast cancer of small size.[199]
</p><h3>Breast cancer cell lines[edit]</h3><div>See also: List of breast cancer cell lines</div><p>A considerable part of the current knowledge on breast carcinomas is based on in vivo and in vitro studies performed with cell lines derived from breast cancers. These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating stromal cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard media. The first breast cancer cell line described, BT-20, was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumors, mainly from pleural effusions. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumor cells with little or no contamination by fibroblasts and other tumor stroma cells.
Many of the currently used BCC lines were established in the late 1970s. A very few of them, namely MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231, account for more than two-thirds of all abstracts reporting studies on mentioned breast cancer cell lines, as concluded from a Medline-based survey.
</p><h3>Molecular markers[edit]</h3><h4>Transcription factors[edit]</h4><p>NFAT transcription factors are implicated in breast cancer, more specifically in the process of cell motility at the basis of metastasis formation. Indeed, NFAT1 (NFATC2) and NFAT5 are pro-invasive and pro-migratory in breast carcinoma[200][201]  and NFAT3 (NFATc4) is an inhibitor of cell motility.[202]
NFAT1 regulates the expression of the TWEAKR and its ligand TWEAK with the Lipocalin 2 to increase breast cancer cell invasion[203] and NFAT3 inhibits Lipocalin 2 expression to blunt the cell invasion.[202]
</p><h4>Metabolic markers[edit]</h4><p>Clinically, the most useful metabolic markers in breast cancer are the estrogen and progesterone receptors that are used to predict response to hormone therapy. New or potentially new markers for breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2[204] to identify people at high risk of developing breast cancer, HER-2,[medical citation needed] and SCD1, for predicting response to therapeutic regimens, and urokinase plasminogen activator, PA1-1 and SCD1 for assessing prognosis.[medical citation needed]
</p>"
21,carcinoma colon,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>It has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors, and about a quarter of all cases are preventable.[75] Increasing surveillance, engaging in physical activity, consuming a diet high in fiber, and reducing smoking and alcohol consumption decrease the risk.[76][77]
</p><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><p>Lifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and obesity.[78][79] The risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet.[80]
</p><p>Starting in the 1970s, dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats. This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies. However, large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions (outside of eating a healthy diet) will have significant protective effects.[81]:432–433[82]:125–126 In 2018 the National Cancer Institute stated that ""There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree.""[78][83]
</p><p>With regard to dietary fiber, the 2014 World Health Organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer, but most studies have not borne this out, and status of the science remained unclear as of 2014.[82] A 2019 review however found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains.[84] The World Cancer Research Fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as ""probable"" as of 2017.[85]
</p><p>Higher physical activity is recommended.[20][86] Physical exercise is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk.[87][88] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of colon cancer by about 21%.[89] Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from colon cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.[90]
</p><h3>Medication and supplements[edit]</h3><p>Aspirin and celecoxib appear to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in those at high risk.[91][92] Aspirin is recommended in those who are 50 to 60 years old, do not have an increased risk of bleeding, and are at risk for cardiovascular disease to prevent colorectal cancer.[93] It is not recommended in those at average risk.[94]
</p><p>There is tentative evidence for calcium supplementation, but it is not sufficient to make a recommendation.[95] Vitamin D intake and blood levels are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer.[96][97]
</p><h3>Screening[edit]</h3><p>As more than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and for prevention.[19][98] Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2–3 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms.[19] Any polyps that are detected can be removed, usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and thus prevent them from turning into cancer. Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.[99]
</p><p>The three main screening tests are colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42% of cancers are found.[100] Flexible sigmoidoscopy, however, has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause.[101]
</p><p>Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) of the stool is typically recommended every two years and can be either guaiac-based or immunochemical.[19] If abnormal FOBT results are found, participants are typically referred for a follow-up colonoscopy examination. Yearly to every two year FOBT screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths by 16% and among those participating in screening colorectal cancer deaths can be reduced up to 23%, although it has not been proven to reduce all-cause mortality.[102] Immunochemical tests are accurate and do not require dietary or medication changes before testing.[103]
</p><p>Other options include virtual colonoscopy and stool DNA screening testing (FIT-DNA). Virtual colonoscopy via a CT scan appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive, associated with radiation exposure, and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths like standard colonoscopy can.[19] Stool DNA screening test looks for biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions, including altered DNA and blood hemoglobin. A positive result should be followed by colonoscopy. FIT-DNA has more false positives than FIT and thus results in more adverse effects.[5] Further study is required as of 2016 to determine if a three-year screening interval is correct.[5]
</p><h4>Recommendations[edit]</h4><p>In the United States, screening is typically recommended between ages 50 to 75 years.[5] The American Cancer Society recommends starting at the age of 45.[104] For those between 76 and 85 years old, the decision to screen should be individualized.[5] Several screening methods can be used, including stool based tests every 3 years, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years and colonoscopy every 10 years. For those at high risk, screenings usually begin at around 40.[19][105] It is unclear which of these two methods is better.[106] Colonoscopy may find more cancers in the first part of the colon, but is associated with greater cost and more complications.[106] For people with average risk who have had a high-quality colonoscopy with normal results, the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend any type of screening in the 10 years following the colonoscopy.[107][108] For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, screening is not recommended.[109] It takes about 10 years after screening for one out of a 1000 people to benefit.[110] The USPSTF list seven potential strategies for screening, with the most important thing being that at least one of these strategies is appropriately used.[5]
</p><p>In Canada, among those 50 to 75 years old at normal risk, fecal immunochemical testing or FOBT is recommended every two years or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years.[111] Colonoscopy is less preferred.[111]
</p><p>Some countries have national colorectal screening programs which offer FOBT screening for all adults within a certain age group, typically starting between ages 50 to 60. Examples of countries with organised screening include the United Kingdom,[112] Australia,[113] and the Netherlands.[114]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatment of colorectal cancer can be aimed at cure or palliation. The decision on which aim to adopt depends on various factors, including the person's health and preferences, as well as the stage of the tumor.[115] When colorectal cancer is caught early, surgery can be curative. However, when it is detected at later stages (for which metastases are present), this is less likely and treatment is often directed at palliation, to relieve symptoms caused by the tumour and keep the person as comfortable as possible.[19]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><div> A diagram of a local resection of early stage colon cancer</div><div> A diagram of local surgery for rectal cancer</div><p>If the cancer is found at a very early stage, it may be removed during a colonoscopy.[6] For people with localized cancer, the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins, with the attempt of achieving a cure. This can either be done by an open laparotomy or sometimes laparoscopically.[19] The colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a colostomy.[6]
</p><p>If there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs they may also be removed. Sometimes chemotherapy is used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it. The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs.[19]
</p><h3>Chemotherapy[edit]</h3><p>In both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.
</p><p>In Stage I colon cancer, no chemotherapy is offered, and surgery is the definitive treatment. The role of chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer is debatable, and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as T4 tumor, undifferentiated tumor, vascular and perineural invasion or inadequate lymph node sampling is identified.[116] It is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy. For stage III and Stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment.[19]
</p><p>If cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which is the case with stage III and stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding chemotherapy agents fluorouracil, capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy. If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial. If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative. Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used.[19] Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT.[117] The drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication while fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine. Some specific regimens used for CRC are CAPOX, FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI.[118] Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy. Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the two FDA approved ones are cetuximab and panitumumab.[119]
</p><p>The primary difference in the approach to low stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy. Often, it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection, so that ultimately as colostomy is not required. However, it may not be possible in low lying tumors, in which case, a permanent colostomy may be required. Stage IV rectal cancer is treated similar to stage IV colon cancer.
</p><h3>Radiation therapy[edit]</h3><p>While a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer,[19] its use in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation.[120] Just as for chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting for some stages of rectal cancer. For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment.[121]
</p><h3>Immunotherapy[edit]</h3><p>Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been found to be useful for a type of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability.[122][123] Pembrolizumab is approved for advanced CRC tumours that are MMR deficient and have failed usual treatments.[124] Most people who do improve, however, still worsen after months or years.[123] Other types of colorectal cancer as of 2017 is still being studied.[122][123]
</p><h3>Palliative care[edit]</h3><p>Palliative care is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms.[125][126]
</p><p>Involvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family, by improving symptoms, anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital.[127]
</p><p>In people with incurable colorectal cancer, palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer, thereby improving quality of life. Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement. These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.[128] Non-operative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications.[129]
</p><h3>Follow-up[edit]</h3><p>The aims of follow-up are to diagnose, in the earliest possible stage, any metastasis or tumors that develop later, but did not originate from the original cancer (metachronous lesions).
</p><p>The U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer.[130][131] A medical history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years. Carcinoembryonic antigen blood level measurements follow the same timing, but are only advised for people with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention. A CT-scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure). A colonoscopy can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months. If a villous polyp, a polyp >1 centimeter or high grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years. For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.
</p><p>Routine PET or ultrasound scanning, chest X-rays, complete blood count or liver function tests are not recommended.[130][131] A 2016 systematic review concluded that more intense surveillance and close follow-up does not provide additional survival benefits in non-metastatic colorectal cancers.[132]
</p><h3>Exercise[edit]</h3><p>Exercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy to cancer survivors. In epidemiological studies, exercise may decrease colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting. These differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and expression of biomarkers. Patients with tumors that lacked CTNNB1 expression (β-catenin), involved in Wnt signalling pathway, required more than 18 Metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week, a measure of exercise, to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. The mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways. In clinical studies, a pro-inflammatory response was found in patients with stage II-III colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy. Oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for benefits observed. A significant decrease in 8-oxo-dG was found in the urine of patients who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy. Other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormone and sex-steroid hormones, although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers[133][134]
</p><p>Another potential biomarker may be p27. Survivors with tumors that expressed p27 and performed greater and equal to 18 MET hours per week were found to have reduced colorectal-cancer mortality survival compared to those with less than 18 MET hours per week. Survivors without p27 expression who exercised were shown to have worse outcomes. The constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may explain the loss of p27 and excess energy balance may up-regulate p27 to stop cancer cells from dividing.[134]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Preliminary in-vitro evidence suggests lactic acid bacteria (e.g., lactobacilli, streptococci or lactococci) may be protective against the development and progression of colorectal cancer through several mechanisms such as antioxidant activity, immunomodulation, promoting programmed cell death, antiproliferative effects, and epigenetic modification of cancer cells.[147]
</p><p>Mouse models of colorectal and intestinal cancer have been developed and are used in research.[148][149][150]

22,carcinoma of lung,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div> Cross section of a human lung: The white area in the upper lobe is cancer; the black areas are discoloration due to smoking.</div><p>Smoking prevention and smoking cessation are effective ways of preventing the development of lung cancer.[78]
</p><h3>Smoking ban[edit]</h3><div>See also: Smoking ban</div><p>While in most countries industrial and domestic carcinogens have been identified and banned, tobacco smoking is still widespread. Eliminating tobacco smoking is a primary goal in the prevention of lung cancer, and smoking cessation is an important preventive tool in this process.[79]
</p><p>Policy interventions to decrease passive smoking in public areas such as restaurants and workplaces have become more common in many Western countries.[80] Bhutan has had a complete smoking ban since 2005[81] while India introduced a ban on smoking in public in October 2008.[82] The World Health Organization has called for governments to institute a total ban on tobacco advertising to prevent young people from taking up smoking. They assess that such bans have reduced tobacco consumption by 16% where instituted.[83]
</p><h3>Screening[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Lung cancer screening</div><p>Cancer screening uses medical tests to detect disease in large groups of people who have no symptoms.[84] For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to it in a way that prolongs life.[66][85] This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%).[86][87] High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.[66]
</p><p>CT screening is associated with a high rate of falsely positive tests which may result in unneeded treatment.[88] For each true positive scan there are about 19 falsely positives scans.[89] Other concerns include radiation exposure[88] and the cost of testing along with follow up.[66] Research has not found two other available tests—sputum cytology or chest radiograph (CXR) screening tests—to have any benefit.[85][90]
</p><p>The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends yearly screening using low-dose computed tomography in those who have a total smoking history of 30 pack-years and are between 55 and 80 years old until a person has not been smoking for more than 15 years.[91] Screening should not be done in those with other health problems that would make treatment of lung cancer if found not an option.[91] The English National Health Service was in 2014 re-examining the evidence for screening.[92]
</p><h3>Other prevention strategies[edit]</h3><p>The long-term use of supplemental vitamin A,[93][94] vitamin C,[93] vitamin D[95] or vitamin E[93] does not reduce the risk of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk,[29][96] but this may be due to confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit and vegetables diet with less smoking.[97] Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk,[1][96] although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.[98]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Treatment of lung cancer</div><p>Treatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has spread, and the person's performance status. Common treatments include palliative care,[99] surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.[1] Targeted therapy of lung cancer is growing in importance for advanced lung cancer.
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Lung cancer surgery</div><div> Pneumonectomy specimen containing a squamous-cell carcinoma, seen as a white area near the bronchi</div><p>If investigations confirm NSCLC, the stage is assessed to determine whether the disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread to the point where it cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination.[1] If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy.[100] Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery.[16] If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.[1]
</p><p>In most cases of early-stage NSCLC, removal of a lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the surgical treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has a higher risk of recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed.[101] Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery.[102] VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.[103]
</p><p>In SCLC, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is typically used.[104] However the role of surgery in SCLC is being reconsidered. Surgery might improve outcomes when added to chemotherapy and radiation in early stage SCLC.[105]
</p><h3>Radiotherapy[edit]</h3><p>Radiotherapy is often given together with chemotherapy, and may be used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who are not eligible for surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy.[106] A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period.[107] Postoperative (adjuvant) thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative-intent surgery for NSCLC.[108] Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.[109]
</p><p>For potentially curable SCLC cases, chest radiotherapy is often recommended in addition to chemotherapy.[6]
</p><div> Internal radiotherapy for lung cancer given via the airway.</div><p>If cancer growth blocks a short section of bronchus, brachytherapy (localized radiotherapy) may be given directly inside the airway to open the passage. Compared to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff.[110] Evidence for brachytherapy, however, is less than that for external beam radiotherapy.[111]
</p><p>Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is a type of radiotherapy to the brain, used to reduce the risk of metastasis. PCI is most useful in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.[112]
</p><p>Recent improvements in targeting and imaging have led to the development of stereotactic radiation in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered over a number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities.[113]
</p><p>For both NSCLC and SCLC patients, smaller doses of radiation to the chest may be used for symptom control (palliative radiotherapy).[114]
</p><h3>Chemotherapy[edit]</h3><p>The chemotherapy regimen depends on the tumor type.[6] SCLC, even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation.[115] In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used.[116] Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used.[117][118] In advanced NSCLC, chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment.[119] Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel,[120][121] pemetrexed,[122] etoposide or vinorelbine.[121] Platinum-based drugs and combinations that include platinum therapy may lead to a higher risk of serious adverse effects in people over 70 years old.[123]
</p><p>Adjuvant chemotherapy refers to the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy (including or not including postoperative radiotherapy) improves survival by 4% at five years.[124][125][126] The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens.[125] Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit.[127] Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically may improve outcomes.[128][129]
</p><p>Chemotherapy may be combined with palliative care in the treatment of the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life.[130] With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents.[131][132] The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.[119][133]
</p><h3>Targeted therapy[edit]</h3><p>Several drugs that target molecular pathways in lung cancer are available, especially for the treatment of advanced disease. Erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib inhibit tyrosine kinase at the epidermal growth factor receptor. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand. It may be useful in the treatment of bone metastases.[134]
</p><h3>Bronchoscopy[edit]</h3><p>Several treatments can be administered via bronchoscopy for the management of airway obstruction or bleeding. If an airway becomes obstructed by cancer growth, options include rigid bronchoscopy, balloon bronchoplasty, stenting, and microdebridement.[135] Laser photosection involves the delivery of laser light inside the airway via a bronchoscope to remove the obstructing tumor.[136]
</p><h3>Palliative care[edit]</h3><p>Palliative care when added to usual cancer care benefits people even when they are still receiving chemotherapy.[137] These approaches allow additional discussion of treatment options and provide opportunities to arrive at well-considered decisions.[138][139] Palliative care may avoid unhelpful but expensive care not only at the end of life, but also throughout the course of the illness. For individuals who have more advanced disease, hospice care may also be appropriate.[16][139]
</p><h2>Research directions[edit]</h2><p>Current research directions for lung cancer treatment include immunotherapy,[183][184] which encourages the body's immune system to attack the tumor cells, epigenetics, and new combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both on their own and together.  Many of these new treatments work through immune checkpoint blockade, disrupting cancer's ability to evade the immune system.[183][184]
</p><p>Ipilimumab blocks signaling through a receptor on T cells known as CTLA-4 which dampens down the immune system. It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of melanoma and is undergoing clinical trials for both NSCLC and SCLC.[183]
</p><p>Other immunotherapy treatments interfere with the binding of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein with its ligand PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and have been approved as first- and subsequent-line treatments for various subsets of lung cancers.[184] Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to switch off T cells that might recognise them as a threat. Monoclonal antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab,[63] atezolizumab, and durvalumab[184] are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.[183][184]
</p><p>Epigenetics is the study of small, usually heritable, molecular modifications—or ""tags""—that bind to DNA and modify gene expression levels. Targeting these tags with drugs can kill cancer cells. Early-stage research in NSCLC using drugs aimed at epigenetic modifications shows that blocking more than one of these tags can kill cancer cells with fewer side effects.[185] Studies also show that giving patients these drugs before standard treatment can improve its effectiveness. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate how well these drugs kill lung cancer cells in humans.[185] Several drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms are in development. Histone deacetylase inhibitors in development include valproic acid, vorinostat, belinostat, panobinostat, entinostat, and romidepsin. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in development include decitabine, azacytidine, and hydralazine.[59]
</p><p>The TRACERx project is looking at how NSCLC develops and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment.[186] The project will look at tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, post-treatment, and relapse.[187] By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The results of this project will help scientists and doctors gain a better understanding of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.[186]
</p><p>For lung cancer cases that develop resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, new drugs are in development. New EGFR inhibitors include afatinib and dacomitinib. An alternative signaling pathway, c-Met, can be inhibited by tivantinib and onartuzumab. New ALK inhibitors include crizotinib and ceritinib.[188] If the MAPK/ERK pathway is involved, the BRAF kinase inhibitor dabrafenib and the MAPK/MEK inhibitor trametinib may be beneficial.[189]
</p><p>Lung cancer stem cells are often resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This may lead to relapse after treatment. New approaches target protein or glycoprotein markers that are specific to the stem cells. Such markers include CD133, CD90, ALDH1A1, CD44 and ABCG2. Signaling pathways such as Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch are often implicated in the self-renewal of stem cell lines. Thus treatments targeting these pathways may help to prevent relapse.[190]

23,carcinoma prostate,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Diet and lifestyle[edit]</h3><p>The data on the relationship between diet and prostate cancer is poor.[84] In light of this, the rate of prostate cancer is linked to the consumption of the Western diet.[84] There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat, and carbohydrate intake and risk of prostate cancer.[84][85] Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing prostate cancer does not suggest that they reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although additional research is needed.[84][86] Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk.[16][84] High calcium intake has been linked to advanced prostate cancer.[87]
</p><p>Consuming fish may lower prostate-cancer deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence.[88] Some evidence supports lower rates of prostate cancer with a vegetarian diet.[89] There is some tentative evidence for foods containing lycopene and selenium.[90][91] Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, soy, beans and other legumes may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, especially more advanced cancers.[92]
</p><p>Men who get regular exercise may have a slightly lower risk, especially vigorous activity and the risk of advanced prostate cancer.[92]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>In those who are being regularly screened, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) reduce the overall risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer, but there are insufficient data to determine if they have an effect on the risk of death and they may increase the chance of more serious cases.[93]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of prostate cancer</div><p>The first decision to be made in managing prostate cancer is whether treatment is needed. Prostate cancer, especially low-grade forms found in elderly men, often grows so slowly that no treatment is required.[102] Treatment may also be inappropriate if a person has other serious health problems or is not expected to live long enough for symptoms to appear. Alternative approaches that delay active treatment and instead involve surveillance of diagnosed prostate cancers are termed expectant management.[102] Expectant management is divided into two approaches: Watchful Waiting, which has palliative intent, and Active Surveillance, which has curative intent.[102]
</p><p>Which option is best depends on the stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are age, general health, and a person's views about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because most treatments can have significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations. A combination of the treatment options is often recommended for managing prostate cancer.[103][104][105]
</p><p>Guidelines for treatment for specific clinical situations requires a good estimation of a person's long-term life expectancy.[106] People can also use an 18-item questionnaire to learn whether they have good knowledge and understanding about their treatment options before they choose. Most of those who are newly diagnosed and made a treatment choice can not correctly answer over half of the questions.[106] Radiotherapy and surgery appear to result in similar outcomes with respect to bowel, erectile and urinary function after five years.[107]
</p><p>If radiation therapy is done first, and fails, then radical prostatectomy may be an option though it becomes a very technically challenging surgery, is associated with decreased quality of life and may not be feasible.[108] On the other hand, radiation therapy done after surgical failure may have many complications.[109] It is associated with a small increase in bladder and colon cancer.[110]
</p><p>In localized disease, it is unknown if radical prostatectomy is better or worse than watchful waiting.[111]
</p><p>A meta-analysis on the effects of voiding position during urination in males with prostate enlargement showed that sitting was superior to standing. Bladder emptying was significantly improved, while there was a trend towards a higher urinary flow and shorter voiding time.[112]
</p><h3>Surveillance[edit]</h3><p>Many men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer are eligible for active surveillance. This means that careful observation of the tumor is conducted over time, with the intention of initiating treatment if there are signs of cancer progression. Active surveillance is not synonymous with watchful waiting, an older term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that palliative, not curative, treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.[102]
</p><p>Active surveillance involves monitoring the tumor for signs of growth or the appearance of symptoms. The monitoring process may involve serial PSA tests, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies. The goal of surveillance is to avoid overtreatment and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor (that in most people, would be unlikely to cause problems). This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause anxiety for people who wrongly believe that all cancer is deadly or themselves to have life-threatening cancer. For 50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies from other causes.[113]
</p><h3>Aggressive cancer[edit]</h3><p>Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer can be difficult.[114] Treatment of aggressive prostate cancers may involve surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy), external beam radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), chemotherapy, oral chemotherapeutic drugs (temozolomide/TMZ), cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, or some combination.[115][116]
</p><p>Although the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the US has resulted in diagnosis at earlier age and cancer stage, the vast majority of cases are still diagnosed in men older than 65 years, and approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in men older than 75 years.[117] Though US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend using life expectancy greater than or less than 10 years to help make treatment decisions, in practice, many elderly patients are not offered curative treatment options such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and are instead treated with hormonal therapy or watchful waiting.[118] This pattern can be attributed to factors such as medical co-morbidity and patient preferences is regard to quality of life in addition to prostate cancer specific risk factors such as pretreatment PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage. As the average life expectancy increases due to advances in the treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other chronic diseases, it is likely that more elderly patients will be living long enough to suffer the consequences of their prostate cancer. Therefore, there is currently much interest in the role of aggressive prostate cancer treatment modalities such as with surgery or radiation in the elderly population who have localized disease.
</p><p>If the cancer has spread beyond the prostate, treatment options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer use a variety of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, HIFU, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. There are exceptions: local or metastasis-directed therapy by radiation treatment may be used for advanced tumors with a limited amount of metastases,[119] and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.
</p><p>Sipuleucel-T, a cancer vaccine has been found to result in a benefit (a four-month increase in survival) for men with metastatic prostate cancer.[120]
</p><h3>Castration-resistant[edit]</h3><p>Most hormone dependent cancers become resistant to treatment after one to three years and resume growth despite hormone therapy. Previously considered ""hormone-refractory prostate cancer"" or ""androgen-independent prostate cancer"", the term castration-resistant has replaced ""hormone refractory"" because while they are no longer responsive to castration treatment (reduction of available androgen/testosterone/DHT by chemical or surgical means), these cancers still show reliance upon hormones for androgen receptor activation.[121]
</p><p>The cancer chemotherapic docetaxel has been used as treatment for CRPC with a median survival benefit of 2 to 3 months.[122][123] A second-line chemotherapy treatment is cabazitaxel.[124] A combination of bevacizumab, docetaxel, thalidomide and prednisone appears effective in the treatment of CRPC.[125]
</p><p>The immunotherapy treatment with sipuleucel-T in CRPC increases survival by 4 months.[126] The second line hormonal therapy abiraterone increases survival by 4.6 months when compared to placebo.[127] Enzalutamide is another second line hormonal agent with a 5-month survival advantage over placebo. Both abiraterone and enzalutamide are currently being tested in clinical trials in those with CRPC who have not previously received chemotherapy.[128][129]
</p><p>Only a subset of people respond to androgen signaling blocking drugs and certain cells with characteristics resembling stem cells remain unaffected.[130][131] Therefore, the desire to improve outcome of people with CRPC has resulted in the claims of increasing doses further or combination therapy with synergistic androgen signaling blocking agents.[132] But even these combination will not affect stem-like cells that do not exhibit androgen signaling. It is possible that for further advances, a combination of androgen signaling blocking agent with stem-like cell directed differentiation therapy drug would prove ideal.[133]
</p><h3>Palliative care[edit]</h3><p>Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer can be difficult.[114] Treatment of aggressive prostate cancers may involve surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy), external beam radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), chemotherapy, oral chemotherapeutic drugs (temozolomide/TMZ), cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, or some combination.[115][116]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><div>For the journal, see Prostate Cancer (journal).</div><h3>CRPC[edit]</h3><p>MDV3100 was in phase III trials for CRPC (chemo-naive and post-chemo patient populations)[185] and gained FDA approval in 2012 as enzalutamide for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.[128][129]
</p><p>Alpharadin completed a phase 3 trial for CRPC patients with bone metastasis. A pre-planned interim analysis showed improved survival and quality of life. The study was stopped for ethical reasons to give the placebo group the same treatment. Alpharadin uses bone targeted Radium-223 isotopes to kill cancer cells by alpha radiation.[186][unreliable medical source?] It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May, 15, 2013, ahead of schedule under the priority review program.[187] Alpharadin still waits for approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
</p><p>As of 2016[update] PARP inhibitor olaparib has shown promise in clinical trials for CRPC.[188] Also in trials for CRPC are : checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab, CYP17 inhibitor galeterone (TOK-001), and immunotherapy PROSTVAC.[188]
</p><p>All medications for CRPC block AR signaling via direct or indirect targeting of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD). Over the last decade molecules that could successfully target these alternative domains have emerged.[189] Such therapies could provide an advantage; particularly in treating prostate cancers that are resistant to current therapies like enzalutamide.[189]
</p><h3>Pre-clinical[edit]</h3><p>Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase has been identified as playing a significant role in the survival of prostate cancer cells.[190][191][192] Medications which target this enzyme may be an effective therapy for limiting tumor growth and cancer metastasis as well as inducing programmed cell death in cancer cells.[190][191][192] In particular, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors produce massive, rapid programmed cell death in prostate cancer cells.[190][191][192]
</p><p>Several medications that target alternative domains on the androgen receptor (DNA binding domain - DBD, and transactivation domain - TAD) or degrade cellular AR protein have reached clinical trials, while some are in pre-clinical development.[189] These therapies hold promis in treating AR dependent prostate cancers both in early and late stage, because many have shown the ability to target both the full-length and the splice-variant forms of the androgen receptor.[189]
</p><h3>Cancer models[edit]</h3><p>Scientists have established a few prostate cancer cell lines to investigate the mechanism involved in the progression of prostate cancer. LNCaP, PC-3 (PC3), and DU-145 (DU145) are commonly used prostate cancer cell lines. The LNCaP cancer cell line was established from a human lymph node metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were established from human prostatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to bone and to brain, respectively. LNCaP cells express androgen receptor (AR), but PC-3 and DU-145 cells express very little or no AR. AR, an androgen-activated transcription factor, belongs to the steroid nuclear receptor family. Development of the prostate is dependent on androgen signaling mediated through AR, and AR is also important during the development of prostate cancer.
</p><p>The proliferation of LNCaP cells is androgen-dependent but the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells is androgen-insensitive. Elevation of AR expression is often observed in advanced prostate tumors in patients.[193][194] Some androgen-independent LNCaP sublines have been developed from the ATCC androgen-dependent LNCaP cells after androgen deprivation for study of prostate cancer progression. These androgen-independent LNCaP cells have elevated AR expression and express prostate specific antigen upon androgen treatment. The paradox is that androgens inhibit the proliferation of these androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.[195][196][197]
</p><h3>Infections[edit]</h3><p>In 2006, a previously unknown retrovirus, Xenotropic MuLV-related virus (XMRV), was associated with human prostate tumors,[198] but subsequent reports on the virus were contradictory,[199][200] and the original 2006 finding was instead due to a previously undetected contamination.[201] The journals Science and PlosONE both retracted XMRV related articles.[202][203]
</p><h3>Diagnosis[edit]</h3><p>At present, an active area of research and non-clinically applied investigations involve non-invasive methods of prostate tumor detection.  A molecular test that detects the presence of cell-associated PCA3 mRNA in fluid obtained from the prostate and first-void urine sample has also been under investigation. PCA3 mRNA is expressed almost exclusively by prostate cells and has been shown to be highly over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. The test result is currently reported as a specimen ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA.
</p><p>Although not a replacement for serum PSA level, the PCA3 test is an additional tool to help decide whether, in men suspected of having prostate cancer (especially if an initial biopsy fails to explain the elevated serum PSA), a biopsy/rebiopsy is really needed. The higher the expression of PCA3 in the sample, the greater the likelihood of a positive biopsy; i.e., the presence of cancer cells in the prostate.[204]

24,cardiomyopathy,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment may include suggestion of lifestyle changes to better manage the condition. Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and condition of disease, but may include medication (conservative treatment) or iatrogenic/implanted pacemakers for slow heart rates, defibrillators for those prone to fatal heart rhythms, ventricular assist devices (VADs) for severe heart failure, or ablation for recurring dysrhythmias that cannot be eliminated by medication or mechanical cardioversion. The goal of treatment is often symptom relief, and some patients may eventually require a heart transplant.[10]
</p>"
25,cellulitis,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>In those who have previously had cellulitis, the use of antibiotics may help prevent future episodes.[19] This is recommended by CREST for those who have had more than two episodes.[5] A 2017 meta-analysis found a benefit of preventative antibiotics for recurrent cellulitis in the lower limbs, but the preventative effects appear to diminish after stopping antibiotic therapy.[20]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Antibiotics are usually prescribed, with the agent selected based on suspected organism and presence or absence of purulence,[11] although the best treatment choice is unclear.[21]  If an abscess is also present, surgical drainage is usually indicated, with antibiotics often prescribed for co-existent cellulitis, especially if extensive.[12]  Pain relief is also often prescribed, but excessive pain should always be investigated, as it is a symptom of necrotizing fasciitis.  Elevation of the affected area is often recommended.[citation needed]
</p><p>Steroids may speed recovery in those on antibiotics.[1]
</p><h3>Antibiotics[edit]</h3><p>Antibiotics choices depend on regional availability, but a penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin is currently recommended for cellulitis without abscess.[11] A course of antibiotics is not effective in between 6 and 37% of cases.[22]
</p>"
26,cholecystitis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><div> X-Ray during laparoscopic cholecystectomy</div><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>For most people with acute cholecystitis, the treatment of choice is surgical removal of the gallbladder, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[30] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed using several small incisions located at various points across the abdomen. Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of laparoscopic cholecystectomy when compared to open cholecystectomy (using a large incision in the right upper abdomen under the rib cage). People undergoing laparoscopic surgery report less incisional pain postoperatively as well as having fewer long term complications and less disability following the surgery.[31][32] Additionally, laparoscopic surgery is associated with a lower rate of surgical site infection.[33]
</p><p>During the days prior to laparoscopic surgery, studies showed that outcomes were better following early removal of the gallbladder, preferably within the first week.[34] Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 7 days of visiting a doctor with symptoms) as compared to delayed treatment (more than 6 weeks) may result in shorter hospital stays and a decreased risk of requiring an emergency procedure.[35] There is no difference in terms of negative outcomes including bile duct injury or conversion to open cholecystectomy.[35] For early cholecystectomy, the most common reason for conversion to open surgery is inflammation that hides Calot's triangle. For delayed surgery, the most common reason was fibrotic adhesions.[35]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>Supportive measures may be instituted prior to surgery. These measures include fluid resuscitation. Intravenous opioids can be used for pain control.
</p><p>Antibiotics are often not needed.[36] If used they should target enteric organisms (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae), such as E. coli and Bacteroides. This may consist of a broad spectrum antibiotic; such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate (Timentin), a third generation cephalosporin (e.g.ceftriaxone) or a quinolone antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin) and anaerobic bacteria coverage, such as metronidazole. For penicillin allergic people, aztreonam or a quinolone with metronidazole may be used.
</p><p>In cases of severe inflammation, shock, or if the person has higher risk for general anesthesia (required for cholecystectomy), an interventional radiologist may insert a percutaneous drainage catheter into the gallbladder ('percutaneous cholecystostomy tube') and treat the person with antibiotics until the acute inflammation resolves.  A cholecystectomy may then be warranted if the person's condition improves.
</p><p>Homeopathic approaches to treating cholecystitis have not been validated by evidence and should not be used in place of surgery.
</p>"
27,cholelithiasis,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Maintaining a healthy weight by getting sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet that is high in fiber may help prevent gallstone formation.[2]
</p><p>The medication ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) appears to prevent formation of gallstones during weight loss.[35] A high fat diet during weight loss also appears to prevent gallstones.[35]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><h3>Surgical[edit]</h3><p>Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) has a 99% chance of eliminating the recurrence of cholelithiasis. The lack of a gallbladder may have no negative consequences in many people. However, there is a portion of the population—between 10 and 15%—who develop a condition called postcholecystectomy syndrome[36] which may cause gastrointestinal distress and persistent pain in the upper-right abdomen, as well as a 10% risk of developing chronic diarrhea.[37]
</p><p>There are two surgical options for cholecystectomy:
</p><ul>Open cholecystectomy is performed via an abdominal incision (laparotomy) below the lower right ribs. Recovery typically requires 3–5 days of hospitalization, with a return to normal diet a week after release and to normal activity several weeks after release.[11]
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, introduced in the 1980s, is performed via three to four small puncture holes for a camera and instruments.  Post-operative care typically includes a same-day release or a one night hospital stay, followed by a few days of home rest and pain medication.[11]</ul><h3>Medical[edit]</h3><p>Cholesterol gallstones can sometimes be dissolved with ursodeoxycholic acid taken by mouth, but it may be necessary for the person to take this medication for years.[38] Gallstones may recur, however, once the drug is stopped. Obstruction of the common bile duct with gallstones can sometimes be relieved by endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy (ERS) following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).[38]
</p>"
28,chronic alcoholic intoxication,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Acute alcohol poisoning is a medical emergency due to the risk of death from respiratory depression or aspiration of vomit if vomiting occurs while the person is unresponsive. Emergency treatment strives to stabilize and maintain an open airway and sufficient breathing, while waiting for the alcohol to metabolize. This can be done by removal of any vomitus or, if the person is unconscious or has impaired gag reflex, intubation of the trachea.[32]
</p><p>Other measures may include
</p><ul>Treat low blood sugar, with intravenous sugar solutions as ethanol induced low blood sugar unresponsive to glucagon.
Administer the vitamin thiamine to prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which can cause a seizure (more usually a treatment for chronic alcoholism, but in the acute context usually co-administered to ensure maximal benefit).
Apply hemodialysis if the blood concentration is dangerously high (>400 mg/dL), and especially if there is metabolic acidosis.
Provide oxygen therapy as needed via nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask.
While the medication metadoxine may speed the breakdown of alcohol, use in alcohol intoxication requires further study as of 2017.[5][33] It is approved in a number of countries in Europe, as well as India and Brazil.[33]</ul><p>Additional medication may be indicated for treatment of nausea, tremor, and anxiety.
</p>"
29,chronic kidney failure,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Apart from controlling other risk factors, the goal of therapy is to slow down or halt the progression of CKD. Control of blood pressure and treatment of the original disease are the broad principles of management.
</p><h3>Blood pressure[edit]</h3><p>Generally, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are used, as they have been found to slow the progression.[41] They have also been found to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and death from cardiovascular disease when compared to placebo in individuals with CKD.[41] Furthermore, ACEIs may be superior to ARBs for protection against progression to kidney failure and death from any cause in those with CKD.[41] Aggressive blood pressure lowering decreases peoples risk of death.[42]
</p><p>Although the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs represents the current standard of care for people with CKD, people progressively lose kidney function while on these medications, as seen in the IDNT[43] and RENAL[44] studies, which reported a decrease over time in estimated GFR (an accurate measure of CKD progression, as detailed in the K/DOQI guidelines[38]) in people treated by these conventional methods.
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>Aggressive treatment of high blood lipids is warranted.[45] Low-protein, low-salt diet may result in slower progression of CKD and reduction in proteinuria as well as controlling symptoms of advanced CKD to delay dialysis start.[46] Replacement of erythropoietin and calcitriol, two hormones processed by the kidney, is often necessary in people with advanced disease. Guidelines recommend treatment with parenteral iron prior to treatment with erythropoietin.[47] A target hemoglobin level of 9–12 g/dL is recommended.[48][49] The normalization of hemoglobin has not been found to be of benefit.[50] It is unclear if androgens help with anemia.[51] Phosphate binders are also used to control the serum phosphate levels, which are usually elevated in advanced chronic kidney disease. Although the evidence for them is limited, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and zinc show potential for helping men with sexual dysfunction.[27]
</p><p>At stage 5 CKD, renal replacement therapy is usually required, in the form of either dialysis or a transplant.
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Currently, several compounds are in development for the treatment of CKD.  These include the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) olmesartan medoxomil and sulodexide, a mixture of low molecular weight heparin and dermatan sulfate.[citation needed]
</p>"
30,chronic obstructive airway disease,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Most cases of COPD are potentially preventable through decreasing exposure to smoke and improving air quality.[11] Annual influenza vaccinations in those with COPD reduce exacerbations, hospitalizations and death.[70][71] Pneumococcal vaccination may also be beneficial.[70] Eating a diet high in beta-carotene may help but taking supplements does not seem to.[72] A review of an oral Haemophilus influenzae vaccine found 1.6 exacerbations per year as opposed to a baseline of 2.1 in those with COPD.[73] This small reduction was not deemed significant.[73]
</p><h3>Smoking cessation[edit]</h3><p>Keeping people from starting smoking is a key aspect of preventing COPD.[74] The policies of governments, public health agencies, and antismoking organizations can reduce smoking rates by discouraging people from starting and encouraging people to stop smoking.[75] Smoking bans in public areas and places of work are important measures to decrease exposure to secondhand smoke, and while many places have instituted bans, more are recommended.[11]
</p><p>In those who smoke, stopping smoking is the only measure shown to slow down the worsening of COPD.[76][77] Even at a late stage of the disease, it can reduce the rate of worsening lung function and delay the onset of disability and death.[78] Often, several attempts are required before long-term abstinence is achieved.[75] Attempts over 5 years lead to success in nearly 40% of people.[79]
</p><p>Some smokers can achieve long-term smoking cessation through willpower alone. Smoking, however, is highly addictive,[80] and many smokers need further support. The chance of quitting is improved with social support, engagement in a smoking cessation program, and the use of medications such as nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, or varenicline.[75][77][79] Combining smoking-cessation medication with behavioral therapy is more than twice as likely to be effective in helping people with COPD stop smoking, compared with behavioral therapy alone.[81]
</p><h3>Occupational health[edit]</h3><p>A number of measures have been taken to reduce the likelihood that workers in at-risk industries—such as coal mining, construction, and stonemasonry—will develop COPD.[11] Examples of these measures include the creation of public policy,[11] education of workers and management about the risks, promoting smoking cessation, checking workers for early signs of COPD, use of respirators, and dust control.[82][83] Effective dust control can be achieved by improving ventilation, using water sprays and by using mining techniques that minimize dust generation.[84] If a worker develops COPD, further lung damage can be reduced by avoiding ongoing dust exposure, for example by changing the work role.[85]
</p><h3>Air pollution[edit]</h3><p>Both indoor and outdoor air quality can be improved, which may prevent COPD or slow the worsening of existing disease.[11] This may be achieved by public policy efforts, cultural changes, and personal involvement.[86]
</p><p>A number of developed countries have successfully improved outdoor air quality through regulations. This has resulted in improvements in the lung function of their populations.[11] Those with COPD may experience fewer symptoms if they stay indoors on days when outdoor air quality is poor.[5]
</p><p>One key effort is to reduce exposure to smoke from cooking and heating fuels through improved ventilation of homes and better stoves and chimneys.[86] Proper stoves may improve indoor air quality by 85%. Using alternative energy sources such as solar cooking and electrical heating is also effective. Using fuels such as kerosene or coal might be less bad than traditional biomass such as wood or dung.[11]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>No cure for COPD is known, but the symptoms are treatable and its progression can be delayed.[74] The major goals of management are to reduce risk factors, manage stable COPD, prevent and treat acute exacerbations, and manage associated illnesses.[5] The only measures that have been shown to reduce mortality are smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen.[87] Stopping smoking decreases the risk of death by 18%.[2] Other recommendations include influenza vaccination once a year, pneumococcal vaccination once every five years, and reduction in exposure to environmental air pollution.[2] In those with advanced disease, palliative care may reduce symptoms, with morphine improving the feelings of shortness of breath.[88] Noninvasive ventilation may be used to support breathing.[88] Providing people with a personalized action plan, an educational session, and support for use of their action plan in the event of an exacerbation, reduces the number of hospital visits and encourages early treatment of exacerbations.[89] When self-management interventions, such as taking corticosteroids and using supplemental oxygen, is combined with action plans, health-related quality of life is improved compared to usual care.[90]
</p><h3>Exercise[edit]</h3><p>Pulmonary rehabilitation is a program of exercise, disease management, and counseling, coordinated to benefit the individual.[91] In those who have had a recent exacerbation, pulmonary rehabilitation appears to improve the overall quality of life and the ability to exercise.[92][93] If pulmonary rehabilitation improves mortality rates or hospital readmission rates is unclear.[92] Pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to improve the sense of control a person has over their disease, as well as their emotions.[94]
</p><p>The optimal exercise routine, use of noninvasive ventilation during exercise, and intensity of exercise suggested for people with COPD, is unknown.[93][95][96] Performing endurance arm exercises improves arm movement for people with COPD, and may result in a small improvement in breathlessness.[97] Performing arm exercises alone does not appear to improve quality of life.[97] Breathing exercises in and of themselves appear to have a limited role.[22] Pursed lip breathing exercises may be useful.[21][22] Tai chi exercises appear to be safe to practice for people with COPD, and may be beneficial for pulmonary function and pulmonary capacity when compared to a regular treatment program.[98] Tai Chi was not found to be more effective than other exercise intervention programs.[98] Inspiratory and expiratory muscle training (IMT, EMT) is an effective method for improving activities of daily living (ADL). A combination of IMT and walking exercises at home may help limit breathlessness in cases of severe COPD.[99] Additionally, the use of low amplitude high velocity joint mobilization together with exercise improves lung function and exercise capacity.[100] The goal of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) is to improve thoracic mobility in an effort to reduce the work on the lungs during respiration, to in turn increase exercise capacity as indicated by the results of a systemic medical review.[100]
</p><p>Being either underweight or overweight can affect the symptoms, degree of disability, and prognosis of COPD. People with COPD who are underweight can improve their breathing muscle strength by increasing their calorie intake.[5] When combined with regular exercise or a pulmonary rehabilitation program, this can lead to improvements in COPD symptoms. Supplemental nutrition may be useful in those who are malnourished.[101]
</p><h3>Bronchodilators[edit]</h3><p>Inhaled bronchodilators are the primary medications used,[2] and result in a small overall benefit.[102] The two major types are β2 agonists and anticholinergics; both exist in long-acting and short-acting forms.[103] They reduce shortness of breath, wheeze, and exercise limitation, resulting in an improved quality of life.[104] It is unclear if they change the progression of the underlying disease.[2]
</p><p>In those with mild disease, short-acting agents are recommended on an as needed basis.[2] In those with more severe disease, long-acting agents are recommended.[2] Long-acting agents partly work by reducing hyperinflation.[60] If long-acting bronchodilators are insufficient, then inhaled corticosteroids are typically added.[2] Which type of long-acting agent, tiotropium (a long-acting anticholinergic) or a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) is better is unclear, and trying each and continuing with the one that works best may be advisable.[105] Both types of agent appear to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations by 15–25%.[2] While both may be used at the same time, any added benefit is of questionable significance.[105]
</p><p>Several short-acting β2 agonists are available, including salbutamol (albuterol) and terbutaline.[106] They provide some relief of symptoms for four to six hours.[106] LABAs such as salmeterol, formoterol, and indacaterol are often used as maintenance therapy. Some feel the evidence of benefits is limited,[107] while others view the evidence of benefit as established.[108][109][110] Long-term use appears safe in COPD[111] with adverse effects include shakiness and heart palpitations.[2] When used with inhaled steroids they increase the risk of pneumonia.[2] While steroids and LABAs may work better together,[107] it is unclear if this slight benefit outweighs the increased risks.[112] There is some evidence that combined treatment of LABAs with long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), an anticholinergic, may result in less exacerbations, less pneumonia, an improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1%), and potential improvements in quality of life when compared to treatment with LABA and an inhaled corticosteriod (ICS).[113] All three together, LABA, LAMA, and ICS, have some evidence of benefits.[114] Indacaterol requires an inhaled dose once a day, and is as effective as the other long-acting β2 agonist drugs that require twice-daily dosing for people with stable COPD.[110]
</p><p>Two main anticholinergics are used in COPD, ipratropium and tiotropium. Ipratropium is a short-acting agent, while tiotropium is long-acting. Tiotropium is associated with a decrease in exacerbations and improved quality of life,[115] and tiotropium provides those benefits better than ipratropium.[116] It does not appear to affect mortality or the overall hospitalization rate.[115] Anticholinergics can cause dry mouth and urinary tract symptoms.[2] They are also associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke.[117][118] Aclidinium, another long-acting agent, reduces hospitalizations associated with COPD and improves quality of life.[119][120][121] The LAMA umeclidinium bromide is another anticholinergic alternative.[122] When compared to tiotropium, the LAMAs aclidinium, glycopyrronium, and umeclidinium appear to have a similar level of efficacy; with all four being more effective than placebo.[123] Further research is needed comparing aclidinium to tiotropium.[121]
</p><h3>Corticosteroids[edit]</h3><p>Corticosteroids are usually used in inhaled form, but may also be used as tablets to treat and prevent acute exacerbations. While inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) have not shown benefit for people with mild COPD, they decrease acute exacerbations in those with either moderate or severe disease.[124] By themselves, they have no effect on overall one-year mortality.[87][125] Whether they affect the progression of the disease is unknown.[2] When used in combination with a LABA, they may decrease mortality compared to either ICSs or LABA alone.[126][127] Inhaled steroids are associated with increased rates of pneumonia.[128] Long-term treatment with steroid tablets is associated with significant side effects.[106]
</p><h3>Other medication[edit]</h3><p>Long-term antibiotics, specifically those from the macrolide class such as erythromycin, reduce the frequency of exacerbations in those who have two or more a year.[129][130][needs update] This practice may be cost effective in some areas of the world.[131] Concerns include that of antibiotic resistance and hearing problems with azithromycin.[130] Methylxanthines such as theophylline generally cause more harm than benefit and thus are usually not recommended,[132] but may be used as a second-line agent in those not controlled by other measures.[5] Mucolytics may help to reduce exacerbations in some people with chronic bronchitis.[133] Cough medicines are not recommended.[106]
</p><p>For people with COPD, the use of cardioselective (heart-specific) beta-blocker therapy does not appear to impair respiratory function.[134] Cardioselective beta-blocker therapy should not be contraindicated for people with COPD.[134][135]
</p><h3>Oxygen[edit]</h3><p>Supplemental oxygen is recommended in those with low oxygen levels at rest (a partial pressure of oxygen less than 50–55 mmHg or oxygen saturations of less than 88%).[106][136] In this group of people, it decreases the risk of heart failure and death if used 15 hours per day[106][136] and may improve people's ability to exercise.[137] In those with normal or mildly low oxygen levels, oxygen supplementation may improve shortness of breath when given during exercise, but may not improve breathlessness during normal daily activities or affect the quality of life.[138] A risk of fires and little benefit exist when those on oxygen continue to smoke.[139] In this situation, some recommend against its use.[140] During acute exacerbations, many require oxygen therapy; the use of high concentrations of oxygen without taking into account a person's oxygen saturations may lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide and worsened outcomes.[141][142] In those at high risk of high carbon dioxide levels, oxygen saturations of 88–92% are recommended, while for those without this risk, recommended levels are 94–98%.[142]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>For those with very severe disease, surgery is sometimes helpful and may include lung transplantation or lung volume-reduction surgery,[2] which involves removing the parts of the lung most damaged by emphysema, allowing the remaining, relatively good lung to expand and work better.[106] It seems to be particularly effective if emphysema predominantly involves the upper lobe, but the procedure increases the risks of early death and adverse events.[143] Lung transplantation is sometimes performed for very severe COPD, particularly in younger individuals.[106]
</p><h3>Exacerbations[edit]</h3><p>Acute exacerbations are typically treated by increasing the use of short-acting bronchodilators.[2] This commonly includes a combination of a short-acting inhaled beta agonist and anticholinergic.[48] These medications can be given either via a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer or via a nebulizer, with both appearing to be equally effective.[48][144] Nebulization may be easier for those who are more unwell.[48] Oxygen supplementation can be useful. Excessive oxygen; however, can result in increased CO2 levels and a decreased level of consciousness.[145]
</p><p>Corticosteroids by mouth improve the chance of recovery and decrease the overall duration of symptoms.[2][48] They work equally well as intravenous steroids but appear to have fewer side effects.[146] Five days of steroids work as well as ten or fourteen.[147] In those with a severe exacerbation, antibiotics improve outcomes.[148] A number of different antibiotics may be used including amoxicillin, doxycycline and azithromycin; whether one is better than the others is unclear.[70] The FDA recommends against the use of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects.[149] There is no clear evidence for those with less severe cases.[150][needs update]
</p><p>For people with type 2 respiratory failure (acutely raised CO2 levels) non-invasive positive pressure ventilation decreases the probability of death or the need of intensive care admission.[2] Additionally, theophylline may have a role in those who do not respond to other measures.[2] Fewer than 20% of exacerbations require hospital admission.[48] In those without acidosis from respiratory failure, home care (""hospital at home"") may be able to help avoid some admissions.[48]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><div>See also: COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</div><p>Infliximab, an immune-suppressing antibody, has been tested in COPD; there was a possibility of harm with no evidence of benefit.[176]
</p><p>Roflumilast, cilomilast, and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors act as a bronchodilator and as an anti-inflammatory. They show promise in decreasing the rate of exacerbations, but do not appear to change a persons quality of life.[2][177] Roflumilast and cilomilast may be associated with side effects such as gastrointestinal issues and weight loss. Sleep disturbances and mood disturbances related to roflumilast have also been reported.[177] PDE4 is recommended to be used as an add-on therapy in case of failure of the standard COPD treatment during excerpations.[177]
</p><p>Several new long-acting agents are under development.[2] Treatment with stem cells is under study.[178] While there is tentative data that it is safe, and the animal data is promising, there is little human data as of 2017.[179][180][181][182] The human data has shown poor results.[179][183]
</p><p>A procedure known as targeted lung denervation, which involves decreasing the parasympathetic nervous system supply of the lungs, is being studied but does not have sufficient data to determine its use.[184] The effectiveness of alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation treatment for people who have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is unclear.[185]
</p><p>Research continues into the use of telehealthcare to treat people with COPD when they experience episodes of shortness of breath; treating people remotely may reduce the number of emergency-room visits and improve the person's quality of life.[186]
</p>"
31,cirrhosis,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[citation needed]
</p><p>Little is known about factors affecting cirrhosis risk and progression. Research has suggested that coffee consumption appears to help protect against cirrhosis.[43][44]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Generally, liver damage from cirrhosis cannot be reversed, but treatment can stop or delay further progression and reduce complications. A healthy diet is encouraged, as cirrhosis may be an energy-consuming process. Close follow-up is often necessary. Antibiotics are prescribed for infections, and various medications can help with itching. Laxatives, such as lactulose, decrease the risk of constipation; their role in preventing encephalopathy is limited.
</p><p>Alcoholic cirrhosis caused by alcohol abuse is treated by abstaining from alcohol. Treatment for hepatitis-related cirrhosis involves medications used to treat the different types of hepatitis, such as interferon for viral hepatitis and corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis. Cirrhosis caused by Wilson's disease, in which copper builds up in organs, is treated with chelation therapy (for example, penicillamine) to remove the copper.
</p><h3>Preventing further liver damage[edit]</h3><p>Regardless of the underlying cause of cirrhosis, consumption of alcohol and paracetamol (acetaminophen), as well as other potentially damaging substances, are discouraged. Vaccination of susceptible patients should be considered for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.
Treating the cause of cirrhosis prevents further damage; for example, giving oral antivirals such as entecavir and tenofovir in patients of cirrhosis due to Hepatitis B prevents progression of cirrhosis. Similarly, control of weight and diabetes prevents deterioration in cirrhosis due to Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
</p><h3>Transplantation[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Liver transplantation</div><p>If complications cannot be controlled or when the liver ceases functioning, liver transplantation is necessary. Survival from liver transplantation has been improving over the 1990s, and the five-year survival rate is now around 80%. The survival rate depends largely on the severity of disease and other medical risk factors in the recipient.[45] In the United States, the MELD score is used to prioritize patients for transplantation.[46] Transplantation necessitates the use of immune suppressants (ciclosporin or tacrolimus).
</p><h3>Decompensated cirrhosis[edit]</h3><p>Manifestations of decompensation in cirrhosis include gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), jaundice or ascites. In patients with previously stable cirrhosis, decompensation may occur due to various causes, such as constipation, infection (of any source), increased alcohol intake, medication, bleeding from esophageal varices or dehydration. It may take the form of any of the complications of cirrhosis listed below.
</p><p>People with decompensated cirrhosis generally require admission to a hospital, with close monitoring of the fluid balance, mental status, and emphasis on adequate nutrition and medical treatment – often with diuretics, antibiotics, laxatives or enemas, thiamine and occasionally steroids, acetylcysteine and pentoxifylline.[47] Administration of saline is avoided, as it would add to the already high total body sodium content that typically occurs in cirrhosis. Life expectancy without liver transplant is low, at most 3 years.
</p><h3>Palliative care[edit]</h3><p>Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of a serious illness, such as cirrhosis. The goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the patient's family and it is appropriate at any stage and for any type of cirrhosis.[48]
</p><p>Especially in the later stages, people with cirrhosis experience significant symptoms such as abdominal swelling, itching, leg edema, and chronic abdominal pain which would be amenable for treatment through palliative care.[49] Because the disease is not curable without a transplant, palliative care can also help with discussions regarding the person's wishes concerning health care power of attorney, Do Not Resuscitate decisions and life support, and potentially hospice.[49] Despite proven benefit, people with cirrhosis are rarely referred to palliative care.[50]
</p>"
32,colitis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Some people may be admitted into the hospital following the colonoscopy depending on results.  It is sometimes necessary to get the patient started on a steroid to speed up the healing of the colon. It may also be necessary to get the patient hydrated from the fluid loss and iron replaced from the loss of blood.  After a hospital stay, the patient may be put on a daily medication to manage their  chronic colitis. The medication can be an anti-inflammatory or an immunosuppressant. There are many different types of medication used and the doctor will prescribe the one they see fit. If the patient doesn't respond, new medications will be tried until there is a good fit.
</p><p>Moreover, several studies recently have found significant relationship between colitis and dairy allergy (including: cow milk, cow milk UHT and casein),[6][7][8][9] suggesting some patients may benefit from an elimination diet.
</p>"
33,confusion,"<h2>Treatment for Sudden Confusion</h2><p>Doctors will need to figure out the health problem that’s causing the symptoms. They’ll do an exam and may run blood tests, X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. They’ll also ask questions about the person’s:</p><ul>
Specific symptoms
Daily medications

Alcohol and drug use
</ul><p>Once doctors can get the cause under control, the confusion usually goes away. It can take hours or days to recover, sometimes longer. In the meantime, some people may need medication to keep them calm and help with their confusion.</p><p>As the person gets better, it may help to:</p><ul>
Make sure they get enough to eat and drink.
Encourage them to move around (with your help).
Get them on a normal sleep schedule.
Surround them with comforting and familiar objects (like family photos).
Don’t overwhelm them with too much noise or too many visitors, but don’t isolate them either.
</ul><h2>Can I Prevent Sudden Confusion?</h2><p>It depends on the cause. Your doctor can tell you what you need to do. But if you or someone you know has had sudden confusion in the past, it’s a good idea to:</p><ul>
Make sure your family knows what to do if it happens again.
Go over all the medications you or your loved one take with a doctor during each medical appointment. Check that it’s safe to take them together.
Beforeany kind of surgery, talk to the health care team so they can take steps to lower any chances of sudden confusion.
</ul>"
34,coronary arteriosclerosis,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.[62][63] Medical management of atherosclerosis first involves modification to risk factors–for example, via smoking cessation and diet restrictions.  Prevention then is generally by eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, and maintaining a normal weight.[4]
</p><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>Changes in diet may help prevent the development of atherosclerosis. Tentative evidence suggests that a diet containing dairy products has no effect on or decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease.[64][65]
</p><p>A diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.[66] Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve cardiovascular results.[67] There is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet may be better than a low-fat diet in bringing about long-term changes to cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., lower cholesterol level and blood pressure).[68]
</p><h3>Exercise[edit]</h3><p>A controlled exercise program combats atherosclerosis by improving circulation and functionality of the vessels. Exercise is also used to manage weight in patients who are obese, lower blood pressure, and decrease cholesterol. Often lifestyle modification is combined with medication therapy. For example, statins help to lower cholesterol, antiplatelet medications like aspirin help to prevent clots, and a variety of antihypertensive medications are routinely used to control blood pressure.  If the combined efforts of risk factor modification and medication therapy are not sufficient to control symptoms, or fight imminent threats of ischemic events, a physician may resort to interventional or surgical procedures to correct the obstruction.[69]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment of established disease may include medications to lower cholesterol such as statins, blood pressure medication, or medications that decrease clotting, such as aspirin.[5] A number of procedures may also be carried out such as percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, or carotid endarterectomy.[5]
</p><p>Medical treatments often focus on alleviating symptoms. However measures which focus on decreasing underlying atherosclerosis—as opposed to simply treating symptoms—are more effective.[70] Non-pharmaceutical means are usually the first method of treatment, such as stopping smoking and practicing regular exercise.[71][72] If these methods do not work, medicines are usually the next step in treating cardiovascular diseases and, with improvements, have increasingly become the most effective method over the long term.
</p><p>The key to the more effective approaches is to combine multiple different treatment strategies.[73] In addition, for those approaches, such as lipoprotein transport behaviors, which have been shown to produce the most success, adopting more aggressive combination treatment strategies taken on a daily basis and indefinitely has generally produced better results, both before and especially after people are symptomatic.[70]
</p><h3>Statins[edit]</h3><p>The group of medications referred to as statins are widely prescribed for treating atherosclerosis. They have shown benefit in reducing cardiovascular disease and mortality in those with high cholesterol with few side effects.[74]
</p><p>These data are primarily in middle-age men and the conclusions are less clear for women and people over the age of 70.[75]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>When atherosclerosis has become severe and caused irreversible ischemia, such as tissue loss in the case of peripheral artery disease, surgery may be indicated. Vascular bypass surgery can re-establish flow around the diseased segment of artery, and angioplasty with or without stenting can reopen narrowed arteries and improve bloodflow. Coronary artery bypass grafting without manipulation of the ascending aorta has demonstrated reduced rates of postoperative stroke and mortality compared to traditional on-pump coronary revascularization.[76]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>There is evidence that some anticoagulants, particularly warfarin, which inhibit clot formation by interfering with Vitamin K metabolism, may actually promote arterial calcification in the long term despite reducing clot formation in the short term.[77][78][79]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><h3>Lipids[edit]</h3><p>An indication of the role of HDL on atherosclerosis has been with the rare Apo-A1 Milano human genetic variant of this HDL protein. A small short-term trial using bacterial synthetized human Apo-A1 Milano HDL in people with unstable angina produced fairly dramatic reduction in measured coronary plaque volume in only six weeks vs. the usual increase in plaque volume in those randomized to placebo. The trial was published in JAMA in early 2006.[citation needed]  Ongoing work starting in the 1990s may lead to human clinical trials—probably by about 2008.[needs update]  These may use synthesized Apo-A1 Milano HDL directly, or they may use gene-transfer methods to pass the ability to synthesize the Apo-A1 Milano HDLipoprotein.[citation needed]
</p><p>Methods to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle concentrations, which in some animal studies largely reverses and remove atheromas, are being developed and researched.[citation needed] However, increasing HDL by any means is not necessarily helpful. For example, the drug torcetrapib is the most effective agent currently known for raising HDL (by up to 60%). However, in clinical trials it also raised deaths by 60%.  All studies regarding this drug were halted in December 2006.[80] See CETP inhibitor for similar approaches.
</p><p>The actions of macrophages drive atherosclerotic plaque progression.
Immunomodulation of atherosclerosis is the term for techniques that modulate immune system function to suppress this macrophage action.[81]
</p><p>Research on genetic expression and control mechanisms is progressing.  Topics include:
</p><ul>PPAR, known to be important in blood sugar and variants of lipoprotein production and function;[citation needed]
The multiple variants of the proteins that form the lipoprotein transport particles.[citation needed]</ul><p>Involvement of lipid peroxidation chain reaction in atherogenesis[82] triggered research on the protective role of the heavy isotope (deuterated) polyunsaturated fatty acids (D-PUFAs) that are less prone to oxidation than ordinary PUFAs (H-PUFAs). PUFAs are essential nutrients – they are involved in metabolism in that very form as they are consumed with food. In transgenic mice, that are a model for human-like lipoprotein metabolism, adding D-PUFAs to diet indeed reduced body weight gain, improved cholesterol handling and reduced atherosclerotic damage to aorta.[83][84]
</p><h3>miRNA[edit]</h3><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have complementary sequences in the 3' UTR and 5' UTR of target mRNAs of protein-coding genes, and cause mRNA cleavage or repression of translational machinery. In diseased vascular vessels, miRNAs are dysregulated and highly expressed. miR-33 is found in cardiovascular diseases.[85] It is involved in atherosclerotic initiation and progression including lipid metabolism, insulin signaling and glucose homeostatis, cell type progression and proliferation, and myeloid cell differentiation. It was found in rodents that the inhibition of miR-33 will raise HDL level and the expression of miR-33 is down-regulated in humans with atherosclerotic plaques.[86][87][88]
</p><p>miR-33a and miR-33b are located on intron 16 of human sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) gene on chromosome 22 and intron 17 of SREBP1 gene on chromosome 17.[89] miR-33a/b regulates cholesterol/lipid homeostatis by binding in the 3’UTRs of genes involved in cholesterol transport such as ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters and enhance or represses its expression. Study have shown that ABCA1 mediates transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to Apolipoprotein-1 and it is also important in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, where cholesterol is delivered from peripheral tissue to the liver, where it can be excreted into bile or converted to bile acids prior to excretion.[85] Therefore, we know that ABCA1 plays an important role in preventing cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. By enhancing miR-33 function, the level of ABCA1 is decreased, leading to decrease cellular cholesterol efflux to apoA-1. On the other hand, by inhibiting miR-33 function, the level of ABCA1 is increased and increases the cholesterol efflux to apoA-1. Suppression of miR-33 will lead to less cellular cholesterol and higher plasma HDL level through the regulation of ABCA1 expression.[90]
</p><p>The sugar, cyclodextrin, removed cholesterol that had built up in the arteries of mice fed a high-fat diet.[91]
</p><h3>DNA damage[edit]</h3><p>Aging is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular problems.  The causative basis by which aging mediates its impact, independently of other recognized risk factors, remains to be determined.  Evidence has been reviewed for a key role of DNA damage in vascular aging.[92][93][94]
8-oxoG, a common type of oxidative damage in DNA, is found to accumulate in plaque vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages and endothelial cells,[95] thus linking DNA damage to plaque formation. DNA strand breaks also increased in atherosclerotic plaques.[95] Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging condition in humans.[96]  WS is caused by a genetic defect in a RecQ helicase that is employed in several repair processes that remove damages from DNA.  WS patients develop a considerable burden of atherosclerotic plaques in their coronary arteries and aorta: calcification of the aortic valve is also frequently observed.[93]  These findings link excessive unrepaired DNA damage to premature aging and early atherosclerotic plaque development (see DNA damage theory of aging).
</p><h3>Microorganisms[edit]</h3><p>The microbiota – all the microorganisms in the body, can contribute to atherosclerosis in many ways: modulation of the immune system, changes in metabolism, processing of nutrients and production of certain metabolites that can get into blood circulation.[97]  One such metabolite, produced by gut bacteria, is trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Its levels have been associated with atherosclerosis in human studies and animal research suggest that there can be a causal relation. An association between the bacterial genes encoding trimethylamine lyases — the enzymes involved in TMAO generation — and atherosclerosis has been noted.[98][97]
</p>"
35,coronary heart disease,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.[64][65] Prevention involves adequate physical exercise, decreasing obesity, treating high blood pressure, eating a healthy diet, decreasing cholesterol levels, and stopping smoking. Medications and exercise are roughly equally effective.[66] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of coronary artery disease by about 25%.[67]
</p><p>Most guidelines recommend combining these preventive strategies. A 2015 Cochrane Review found some evidence that counselling and education in an effort to bring about behavioral change might help in high risk groups. However, there was insufficient evidence to show an effect on mortality or actual cardiovascular events.[68]
</p><p>In diabetes mellitus, there is little evidence that very tight blood sugar control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other problems such as kidney failure and blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends ""low to moderate alcohol intake"" to reduce risk of coronary artery disease while high intake increases the risk.[69]
</p><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Diet and heart disease</div><p>A diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.[70] Vegetarians have a lower risk of heart disease,[71][72] possibly due to their greater consumption of fruits and vegetables.[73] Evidence also suggests that the Mediterranean diet[74] and a high fiber diet lower the risk.[75][76]
</p><p>The consumption of trans fat (commonly found in hydrogenated products such as margarine) has been shown to cause a precursor to atherosclerosis[77] and increase the risk of coronary artery disease.[78]
</p><p>Evidence does not support a beneficial role for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in preventing cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death).[79][80] There is tentative evidence that intake of menaquinone (Vitamin K2), but not phylloquinone (Vitamin K1), may reduce the risk of CAD mortality.[81]
</p><h3>Secondary prevention[edit]</h3><p>Secondary prevention is preventing further sequelae of already established disease. Effective lifestyle changes include:
</p><ul>Weight control
Smoking cessation
Avoiding the consumption of trans fats (in partially hydrogenated oils)
Decreasing psychosocial stress[82]
Exercise</ul><p>Aerobic exercise, like walking, jogging, or swimming, can reduce the risk of mortality from coronary artery disease.[83] Aerobic exercise can help decrease blood pressure and the amount of blood cholesterol (LDL) over time. It also increases HDL cholesterol which is considered ""good cholesterol"".[84][85]
</p><p>Although exercise is beneficial, it is unclear whether doctors should spend time counseling patients to exercise. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found ""insufficient evidence"" to recommend that doctors counsel patients on exercise but ""it did not review the evidence for the effectiveness of physical activity to reduce chronic disease, morbidity and mortality"", only the effectiveness of counseling itself.[86] The American Heart Association, based on a non-systematic review, recommends that doctors counsel patients on exercise.[87]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>There are a number of treatment options for coronary artery disease:[88]
</p><ul>Lifestyle changes
Medical treatment – drugs (e.g., cholesterol lowering medications, beta-blockers, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, etc.);
Coronary interventions as angioplasty and coronary stent;
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)</ul><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><ul>Statins, which reduce cholesterol, reduce the risk of coronary artery disease[89]
Nitroglycerin[90]
Calcium channel blockers and/or beta-blockers[91]
Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin[91][92]</ul><p>It is recommended that blood pressure typically be reduced to less than 140/90 mmHg.[93] The diastolic blood pressure however should not be lower than 60 mmHg.[vague] Beta blockers are recommended first line for this use.[93]
</p><h4>Aspirin[edit]</h4><p>In those with no previous history of heart disease, aspirin decreases the risk of a myocardial infarction but does not change the overall risk of death.[94] It is thus only recommended in adults who are at increased risk for coronary artery disease[95] where increased risk is defined as ""men older than 90 years of age, postmenopausal women, and younger persons with risk factors for coronary artery disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes, or smoking) are at increased risk for heart disease and may wish to consider aspirin therapy"". More specifically, high-risk persons are ""those with a 5-year risk ≥ 3%"".[citation needed]
</p><h4>Anti-platelet therapy[edit]</h4><p>Clopidogrel plus aspirin (dual anti-platelet therapy ) reduces cardiovascular events more than aspirin alone in those with a STEMI. In others at high risk but not having an acute event the evidence is weak.[96] Specifically, its use does not change the risk of death in this group.[97] In those who have had a stent more than 12 months of clopidogrel plus aspirin does not affect the risk of death.[98]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Revascularization for acute coronary syndrome has a mortality benefit.[99] Percutaneous revascularization for stable ischaemic heart disease does not appear to have benefits over medical therapy alone.[100] In those with disease in more than one artery coronary artery bypass grafts appear better than percutaneous coronary interventions.[101][102] Newer ""anaortic"" or no-touch off-pump coronary artery revascularization techniques have shown reduced postoperative stroke rates comparable to percutaneous coronary intervention.[103] Hybrid coronary revascularization has also been shown to be a safe and feasible procedure that may offer some advantages over conventional CABG though it is more expensive.[104]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><div>Further information: Atheroma and Atherosclerosis</div><p>Research efforts are focused on new angiogenic treatment modalities and various (adult) stem-cell therapies. A region on chromosome 17 was confined to families with multiple cases of myocardial infarction.[120] Other genome-wide studies have identified a firm risk variant on chromosome 9 (9p21.3).[121] However, these and other loci are found in intergenic segments and need further research in understanding how the phenotype is affected.[122]
</p><p>A more controversial link is that between Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis.[123] While this intracellular organism has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques, evidence is inconclusive as to whether it can be considered a causative factor.[124] Treatment with antibiotics in patients with proven atherosclerosis has not demonstrated a decreased risk of heart attacks or other coronary vascular diseases.[125]
</p><p>Since the 1990s the search for new treatment options for coronary artery disease patients, particularly for so called ""no-option"" coronary patients, focused on usage of angiogenesis[126] and (adult) stem cell therapies. Numerous clinical trials were performed, either applying protein (angiogenic growth factor) therapies, such as FGF-1 or VEGF, or cell therapies using different kinds of adult stem cell populations. Research is still going on – with first promising results particularly for FGF-1[127][128] and utilization of endothelial progenitor cells.
</p><p>Myeloperoxidase has been proposed as a biomarker.[129]
</p><p>Dietary changes can decrease coronary artery disease. For example, data supports benefit from a plant-based diet and aggressive lipid lowering to improve heart disease.[130][needs update]

36,decubitus ulcer,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Nursing has published guidelines in 'Pressure ulcer risk assessment and prevention' that call for identifying people at risk and taking preventative action;[14] the UK National Standards for Care Homes (UK) to do so as well.[15]
</p><p>Internationally, the NPUAP, EPUAP and Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance (Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong) published comprehensive evidence-based clinical practice guidelines[16] in 2014.[17] The guideline was developed by an international team of over 100 clinical specialists and updates the 2009 EPUAP and NPUAP clinical guidelines. The guideline includes recommendations on strategies to prevent pressure ulcers including the use of pressure redistributing support surfaces, repositioning and maintaining appropriate nutritional support.
</p><h3>Redistributing pressure[edit]</h3><p>The most important care for a person at risk for pressure ulcers and those with bedsores is the redistribution of pressure so that no pressure is applied to the pressure ulcer.[18] In the 1940s Ludwig Guttmann introduced a program of turning paraplegics every two hours thus allowing bedsores to heal. Previously such individuals had a two-year life-expectancy, normally succumbing to blood and skin infections. Guttmann had learned the technique from the work of Boston physician Donald Munro.[19]
</p><p>Nursing homes and hospitals usually set programs in place to avoid the development of pressure ulcers in those who are bedridden, such as using a routine time frame for turning and repositioning to reduce pressure. The frequency of turning and repositioning depends on the person's level of risk.
</p><h3>Support surfaces[edit]</h3><p>A 2015 Cochrane review found that people who lay on high specification or high density foam mattresses were 60% less likely to develop new pressure ulcers compared to regular foam mattresses. Sheepskin overlays on top of mattresses were also found to prevent new pressure ulcer formation.[1] There is unclear research on the effectiveness of alternating pressure mattresses. Pressure-redistributive mattresses are used to reduce high values of pressure on prominent or bony areas of the body. There are several important terms used to describe how these support surfaces work. These terms were standardized through the Support Surface Standards Initiative of the NPUAP.[20] Many support surfaces redistribute pressure by immersing and/or enveloping the body into the surface. Some support surfaces, including antidecubitus mattresses and cushions, contain multiple air chambers that are alternately pumped.[21][22] Methods to standardize the products and evaluate the efficacy of these products have only been developed in recent years through the work of the S3I within NPUAP.[23] For individuals with paralysis, pressure shifting on a regular basis and using a wheelchair cushion featuring pressure relief components can help prevent pressure wounds.
</p><p>Controlling the heat and moisture levels of the skin surface, known as skin microclimate management, also plays a significant role in the prevention and control of pressure ulcers.[24]
</p><h3>Nutrition[edit]</h3><p>In addition, adequate intake of protein and calories is important. vitamin C has been shown to reduce the risk of pressure ulcers. People with higher intakes of vitamin C have a lower frequency of bed sores in those who are bedridden than those with lower intakes. Maintaining proper nutrition in newborns is also important in preventing pressure ulcers. If unable to maintain proper nutrition through protein and calorie intake, it is advised to use supplements to support the proper nutrition levels.[25] Skin care is also important because damaged skin does not tolerate pressure. However, skin that is damaged by exposure to urine or stool is not considered a pressure ulcer. These skin wounds should be classified as Incontinence Associated Dermatitis.
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Internationally, the NPUAP, EPUAP and Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance (Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong) published updated evidence-based clinical practice guidelines[16] in 2014.[17] The guideline was developed by an international team of over 100 clinical specialists and updates the 2009 EPUAP and NPUAP clinical guidelines. The guideline includes recommendations on strategies to treat pressure ulcers, including the use of bed rest, pressure redistributing support surfaces, nutritional support, repositioning, wound care (e.g. debridement, wound dressings) and biophysical agents (e.g. electrical stimulation).[26] Reliable scientific evidence to support the use of many of these interventions, though, is lacking. More research is needed to assess how to best support the treatment of pressure ulcers, for example by repositioning.[27][28][29][30] Also, the benefit of using systemic or topical antibiotics in the management of pressure ulcer is still unclear.[31] A 2017 Cochrane review found that it was unclear whether one topical agent or dressing was better than another for treating pressure ulcers. Protease-modulating dressings, foam dressings or collagenase ointment may be better at healing than gauze.[32]
</p><p>The wound dressing should be selected based on the wound and condition of the surrounding skin. There are some studies that indicate that antimicrobial products that stimulate the epithelization may improve the wound healing[33]. However there is no international consensus on the selection of the dressings for pressure ulcers.[34]
</p><h3>Debridement[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Debridement</div><p>Necrotic tissue should be removed in most pressure ulcers. The heel is an exception in many cases when the limb has an inadequate blood supply. Necrotic tissue is an ideal area for bacterial growth, which has the ability to greatly compromise wound healing. There are five ways to remove necrotic tissue.
</p><ol>Autolytic debridement is the use of moist dressings to promote autolysis with the body's own enzymes and white blood cells. It is a slow process, but mostly painless, and is most effective in individuals with a properly functioning immune system.
Biological debridement, or maggot debridement therapy, is the use of medical maggots to feed on necrotic tissue and therefore clean the wound of excess bacteria. Although this fell out of favor for many years, in January 2004, the FDA approved maggots as a live medical device.[35]
Chemical debridement, or enzymatic debridement, is the use of prescribed enzymes that promote the removal of necrotic tissue.
Mechanical debridement, is the use of debriding dressings, whirlpool or ultrasound for slough in a stable wound
Surgical debridement, or sharp debridement, is the fastest method, as it allows a surgeon to quickly remove dead tissue.</ol><h3>Dressing[edit]</h3><p>Some guidelines for dressing are:[36]
</p><table>

Condition
Cover dressing


None to moderate exudates
Gauze with tape or composite


Moderate to heavy exudates
Foam dressing with tape or composite


Frequent soiling
Hydrocolloid dressing, film or composite

37,deep vein thrombosis,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Thrombosis prophylaxis</div><div> The American College of Chest Physicians-suggested graduated compression stockings for at-risk travelers and some hospital patients</div><p>Depending upon the risk for DVT, different preventive measures are recommended. Walking and calf exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress the veins and pump blood up towards the heart.[68] In immobile individuals, physical compression methods improve blood flow. Anticoagulation, which increases the risk of bleeding, might be used in high-risk scenarios. The risk of major bleeding with long-term anticoagulation is about 3% per year,[23] and the point where annual VTE risk is thought to warrant long-term anticoagulation is estimated to be between 3 and 9%.[69] Usually, only when individuals exceed a 9% annual VTE risk is long-term anticoagulation a common consideration.[69] Antithrombin deficiency, a strong or moderately strong risk factor, carries an annual risk of VTE of only 0.8–1.5%;[23] as such, asymptomatic individuals with thrombophilia do not warrant long-term anticoagulation.[70]
</p><p>Aside from anticoagulation, the antiplatelet drug aspirin might be used in some people following orthopedic surgery [71] and in those with a previous VTE.[72] Statins might decrease the risk for people who are otherwise healthy, but the evidence is not clear.[73] Following the completion of warfarin long term aspirin is useful to prevent re occurrence.[74]
</p><h3>Hospital[edit]</h3><p>In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) issued a clinical practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for their risk of thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also drew attention to a lack of support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.[22][75]
</p><p>A 2014 Cochrane review found that using heparin in medical patients did not change the risk of death or pulmonary embolism.[76] While its use decreased people's risks of DVTs, it also increased people's risks of major bleeding.[76] The review thus recommended the need to balance risks and benefits.[76]
</p><p>The 2012 ACCP guidelines for nonsurgical patients[77][h] recommend anticoagulation for the acutely ill in cases of elevated risk when neither bleeding nor a high risk of bleeding exists.[78] Mechanical prophylaxis is suggested when risks for bleeding and thrombosis are elevated.[79] For the critically ill, either pharmacological or mechanical prophylaxis is suggested depending upon the risk.[80] Heparin is suggested in outpatients with cancer who have solid tumors and additional risk factors for VTE—listed as ""previous venous thrombosis, immobilization, hormonal therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, thalidomide, and lenalidomide""—and a low risk of bleeding.[81]
</p><h3>After surgery[edit]</h3><p>Major orthopedic surgery—total hip replacement, total knee replacement, or hip fracture surgery—has a high risk of causing VTE.[82] If prophylaxis is not used after these surgeries, symptomatic VTE has about a 4% chance of developing within 35 days.[83] Options for VTE prevention in people follow nonorthopedic surgery include early walking, mechanical prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression or graduated compression stockings), and drugs (low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose-unfractionated heparin) depending upon the risk of VTE, risk of major bleeding, and person's preferences.[84] Following major orthopedic surgery, the ACCP recommends treatment with drugs that reduce the risk of clots (such as fondaparinux and aspirin) with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) suggested as a preference.[83] Intermittent pneumatic compression is also an option.[83][85] Graduated compression stockings are effective after both general and orthopedic surgery.[86][needs update]
</p><h3>Pregnancy[edit]</h3><div>See also: Hypercoagulability in pregnancy</div><div> Warfarin, a common VKA, is suggested only after childbirth in some at-risk women.</div><p>The risk of VTE is increased in pregnancy by about five times[23][87] because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage.[29] Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE.[88] Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with a family history of VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only.[89] Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.[88][90]
</p><h3>Travelers[edit]</h3><p>The 2012 ACCP guidelines offered weak recommendations. For at-risk long-haul travelers—those with ""previous VTE, recent surgery or trauma, active malignancy, pregnancy, estrogen use, advanced age, limited mobility, severe obesity, or known thrombophilic disorder""—suggestions included calf exercises, frequent walking, and aisle seating in airplanes to ease walking.[91][1] The use of graduated compression stockings that fit below the knee and give 15–30 mm Hg of pressure to the ankle was suggested, while aspirin or anticoagulants were not.[92] Compression stockings have sharply reduced the levels of asymptomatic DVT in airline passengers, but the effect on symptomatic VTE is unknown, as none of the individuals studied developed symptomatic VTE.[93]

</p><p>For acute cases in the leg, the ACCP recommended a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) for at least five days[j] and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin.[98][99] The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months[100] to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target.[101][102] The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends,[103] and the risk of bleeding increases with age.[21]
</p><p>The ACCP recommended treatment for three months in those with proximal DVT provoked by surgery.[104] A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate.[105] Unprovoked DVT patients should have at least three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment.[106] Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of bleeding.[107] In that case, three months is sufficient.[108] Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate,[109] and suggested for three months of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.[110]
</p><h3>Stockings, walking, and repeat imaging[edit]</h3><p>The ACCP recommended initial home treatment instead of hospital treatment for those with acute leg DVT. This applies as long as individuals feel ready for it, and those with severe leg symptoms or comorbidities would not qualify. An appropriate home environment is expected: one that can provide a quick return to the hospital if necessary, support from family or friends, and phone access.[111]
</p><p>In addition to anticoagulation, the ACCP suggested graduated compression stockings—which apply higher pressure (30–40 mm Hg) at the ankles and a lower pressure around the knees[98]—for those with symptomatic DVT.[112] Use should begin as soon as possible after anticoagulation.[98] Evidence however does not support that these stockings reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome nor do they indicate a reduction in recurrent VTE.[113] Use is suggested for two years, though inconvenience and discomfort can reduce compliance.[112] Walking is also suggested for those without severe pain or edema.[114]
</p><p>Unless a person has medical problems preventing movement, after a person starts anti-coagulation therapy bed rest should not be used to treat acute deep vein thrombosis.[115] There are clinical benefits associated with walking and no evidence that walking is harmful, but people with DVT are harmed by bed rest except when it is medically necessary.[115]
</p><p>Instead of anticoagulation, a follow-up imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis is an option for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation.[98][116] This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns about the risk of bleeding are insignificant.[116] When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.[8]
</p><h3>IVC filters, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy[edit]</h3><div> An IVC filter</div><p>Inferior vena cava filters (IVC filters) are used on the presumption that they reduce PE, although their effectiveness and safety profile are not well established.[117] In general, they are only recommended in some high risk scenarios.[117] The ACCP recommended them for those with a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment but not in addition to anticoagulation, unless an individual with an IVC filter but without a risk for bleeding develops acute proximal DVT. In this case, both anticoagulation and an IVC filter are suggested.[118] NICE recommends caval filters in settings where someone with an acute proximal DVT or PE cannot receive anticoagulation, and that the filter is removed when anticoagulation can be safely started.[59] While IVC filters themselves are associated with a long-term risk of DVT,[117] they are not reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation.[119]
</p><p>Thrombolysis is the administration of an enzyme (intravenous or directly into the affected vein through a catheter), which acts to enzymatically break up clots. This may reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome by a third, and possibly reduce the risk of leg ulcers, but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding.[120] The ACCP currently suggests anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis, but patients may choose thrombolysis if prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over the complexity, bleeding risk, and cost of the procedure.[121] NICE recommends that thrombolysis is considered in those who have had symptoms for less than two weeks, are normally well, have a good life expectancy and a low risk of bleeding.[59]
</p><p>A mechanical thrombectomy device can remove venous clots, although the ACCP considers it an option only when the following conditions apply: ""iliofemoral DVT, symptoms for < 7 days (criterion used in the single randomized trial), good functional status, life expectancy of ≥ 1 year, and both resources and expertise are available.""[98] Anticoagulation alone is suggested over thrombectomy.[122]
</p><h2>Research directions[edit]</h2><p>As of 2011, three large randomized controlled trials—the Norwegian CaVent trial, the North American ATTRACT trial, and the Dutch CAVA trial—are studying the effectiveness and safety of catheter-directed thrombolysis.[101] In 2012, two studies[142][143] found a clinical benefit in taking aspirin to prevent recurrent VTE.[72]

38,degenerative polyarthritis,"<h2>How Is Arthritis Treated?</h2><p>Treatment of arthritis generally includes rest, occupational or physical therapy, exercise, drugs, and sometimes surgery to correct joint damage.</p><p>
Treatments for osteoarthritis generally can help relieve pain and stiffness, but the disease may continue to progress. The same was true for rheumatoid arthritis in the past, but newer treatments for rheumatoid arthritis have been able to slow or stop the progression of arthritis damage.</p><p> </p><h2>Arthritis Treatment: Occupational Therapy</h2><p>Protecting your joints is an important part of arthritis treatment. With the help of an occupational therapist, you can learn easier ways to do your normal activities. An occupational therapist can teach you how to:</p><ul>
Avoid positions that strain your joints
Use your strongest joints and muscles while sparing weaker ones
Provide braces or supports to protect certain joints
Use grab bars in the bath
Use modified doorknobs, canes, or walkers
Use devices to help you with tasks such as opening jars or pulling up socks and zippers
</ul><h2>Arthritis Treatment: Medicine</h2><p>Arthritis treatment will depend on the nature and seriousness of the underlying condition. The main goals are to reduce inflammation and improve the function of affected joints before more serious problems occur.</p><h2>Arthritis Treatment: Surgery</h2><p>Various forms of surgery may be needed to reduce the discomfort of arthritis or to restore mobility or joint function. Synovectomy is the removal of damaged connective tissue lining a joint cavity.</p><p>If arthritic pain and inflammation become truly unbearable, or arthritic joints become so damaged, the answer may lie in surgical replacement. Today, knee and hip joints can be replaced with reliable artificial joints made of stainless steel, plastic and ceramic materials. Shoulder joints, as well as smaller joints in the elbows and fingers, can also be replaced.</p><p>Spinal surgery is sometimes performed for neck and lower spine arthritis. Although movement is limited after such surgery, the operations relieve excruciating pain and help prevent further damage to nerves or blood vessels.</p><h2>Non-Medical Management of Arthritis Pain</h2><p>Aside from medical treatments for arthritis, there are effective psychotherapeutic strategies to manage arthritic pain. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has found that cognitive behavioral therapy, using education and behavior modification alongside relaxation techniques, is better than routine care for relieving pain associated with arthritis. Such programs focus on improving patients' emotional and psychological well-being by teaching them how to relax and conduct their daily activities at a realistic pace. Learning to overcome mental stress and anxiety can be the key to coping with the physical limitations that may accompany chronic rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Cognitive therapy may include various techniques for activity scheduling, imaging, relaxation, distraction, and creative problem-solving.</p>"
39,deglutition disorder,"<h2>Treatments[edit]</h2><p>There are many ways to treat dysphagia, such as swallowing therapy, dietary changes, feeding tubes, certain medications, and surgery. Treatment for dysphagia is managed by a group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team. Members of the multidisciplinary team include: a speech language pathologist specializing in swallowing disorders (swallowing therapist), primary physician, gastroenterologist, nursing staff, respiratory therapist, dietitian, occupational therapist, physical therapist, pharmacist, and radiologist.[11] The role of the members of the multidisciplinary team will differ depending on the type of swallowing disorder present. For example, the swallowing therapist will be directly involved in the treatment of a patient with oropharyngeal dysphagia, while a gastroenterologist will be directly involved in the treatment of an esophageal disorder.
</p><h3>Treatment strategies[edit]</h3><p>The implementation of a treatment strategy should be based on a thorough evaluation by the multidisciplinary team. Treatment strategies will differ on a patient to patient basis and should be structured to meet the specific needs of each individual patient. Treatment strategies are chosen based on a number of different factors including diagnosis, prognosis, reaction to compensatory strategies, severity of dysphagia, cognitive status, respiratory function, caregiver support, and patient motivation and interest.[11]
</p><h4>Oral vs. nonoral feeding[edit]</h4><p>Adequate nutrition and hydration must be preserved at all times during dysphagia treatment. The overall goal of dysphagia therapy is to maintain, or return the patient to, oral feeding. However, this must be done while ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration and a safe swallow (no aspiration of food into the lungs).[11] If oral feeding results in increased mealtimes and increased effort during the swallow, resulting in not enough food being ingested to maintain weight, a supplementary nonoral feeding method of nutrition may be needed. In addition, if the patient aspirates food or liquid into the lungs despite the use of compensatory strategies, and is therefore unsafe for oral feeding, nonoral feeding may be needed. Nonoral feeding includes receiving nutrition through a method that bypasses the oropharyngeal swallowing mechanism including a nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy.[11]
</p><h4>Treatment procedures[edit]</h4><p>Compensatory Treatment Procedures - designed to change the flow of the food/liquids and eliminate symptoms, do not directly change the physiology of the swallow.[11]
</p><ul>Postural Techniques</ul><ul>Food Consistency (Diet) Changes</ul><ul>Modifying Volume and Speed of Food Presentation</ul><ul>Technique to Improve Oral Sensory Awareness

Supraglottic swallow
Super-supraglottic swallow
Effortful swallow
Mendelsohn maneuver</ul><p>Patients may need a combination of treatment procedures to maintain a safe and nutritionally adequate swallow. For example, postural strategies may be combined with swallowing maneuvers to allow the patient to swallow in a safe and efficient manner.
</p><p>The most common interventions used for those with oropharyngeal dysphagia by speech language pathologists are texture modification of foods, thickening fluids and positioning changes during swallowing.[20] The effectiveness of modifying food and fluid in preventing aspiration pneumonia has been questioned and these can be associated with poorer nutrition, hydration and quality of life.[21] Also, there has been considerable variability in national approaches to describing different degrees of thickened fluids and food textures.  However, in 2015, the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) group produced an agreed IDDSI framework consisting of a continuum of 8 levels (0-7), where drinks are measured from Levels 0 – 4, while foods are measured from Levels 3 – 7.[22]  It is likely that this initiative, which has widespread support among dysphagia practitioners, will improve communication with carers and will lead to greater standardisation of modified diets
</p>"
40,dehydration,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>For routine activities, thirst is normally an adequate guide to maintain proper hydration.[11] Minimum water intake will vary individually depending on weight, environment, diet and genetics.[12] With exercise, exposure to hot environments, or a decreased thirst response, additional water may be required. In athletes in competition drinking to thirst optimizes performance and safety, despite weight loss, and as of 2010, there was no scientific study showing that it is beneficial to stay ahead of thirst and maintain weight during exercise.[13]
</p><p>In warm or humid weather or during heavy exertion, water loss can increase markedly, because humans have a large and widely variable capacity for the active secretion of sweat. Whole-body sweat losses in men can exceed 2 L/h during competitive sport, with rates of 3–4 L/h observed during short-duration, high-intensity exercise in the heat.[14] When such large amounts of water are being lost through perspiration, electrolytes, especially sodium, are also being lost.
</p><p>In most athletes, exercising and sweating for 4–5 hours with a sweat sodium concentration of less than 50 mmol/L, the total sodium lost is less than 10% of total body stores (total stores are approximately 2,500 mmol, or 58 g for a 70-kg person).[15] These losses appear to be well tolerated by most people. The inclusion of some sodium in fluid replacement drinks has some theoretical benefits[15] and poses little or no risk, so long as these fluids are hypotonic (since the mainstay of dehydration prevention is the replacement of free water losses).
</p><p>The consumption of overly sugary and/or salty foods can cause dehydration.[16]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of dehydration</div><p>The treatment for minor dehydration that is often considered the most effective is drinking water and stopping fluid loss. Plain water restores only the volume of the blood plasma, inhibiting the thirst mechanism before solute levels can be replenished.[17] Solid foods can contribute to fluid loss from vomiting and diarrhea.[18] Urine concentration and frequency will customarily return to normal as dehydration resolves.[19]
</p><p>In some cases, correction of a dehydrated state is accomplished by the replenishment of necessary water and electrolytes (through oral rehydration therapy or fluid replacement by intravenous therapy). As oral rehydration is less painful, less invasive, less expensive, and easier to provide, it is the treatment of choice for mild dehydration.[citation needed] Solutions used for intravenous rehydration must be isotonic or hypertonic.[citation needed]  Pure water injected into the veins will cause the breakdown (lysis) of red blood cells (erythrocytes).[citation needed]
</p><p>When fresh water is unavailable (e.g. at sea or in a desert), seawater and ethanol will worsen the condition. Urine contains a lower solute concentration than seawater, and numerous guides advise against its consumption in survival situations.[20] If somebody is dehydrated and is taken to a hospital, IVs are also used.[21][22][23][24]
</p><p>For severe cases of dehydration where fainting, unconsciousness, or other severely inhibiting symptom is present (the patient is incapable of standing or thinking clearly), emergency attention is required. Fluids containing a proper balance of replacement electrolytes are given orally or intravenously with continuing assessment of electrolyte status; complete resolution is the norm in all but the most extreme cases.[25]

41,delirium,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Using a tailored multi-faceted approach as outlined above can can decreases rates of delirium by 27% among the elderly.[51] At least 30-40% of all cases of delirium could be prevented, and high rates of delirium reflect negatively on the quality of care.[21] Episodes of delirium can be prevented by identifying hospitalized people at risk of the condition: those over age 65, those with a known cognitive impairment, those with hip fracture, those with severe illness.[52] Close observation for the early signs is recommended in such populations.
</p><p>Delirium may be prevented by systematically addressing the common contributing factors, such as constipation, dehydration, low oxygen levels, immobility, and the simultaneous use of multiple or problematic medications.[52] Ensuring a therapeutic environment (e.g. individualized care; clear communication; adequate reorientation and lighting during daytime; promoting uninterrupted sleep hygiene with minimal noise and light at night; minimizing bed relocation; having familiar objects like family pictures; providing earplugs; and providing adequate nutrition, pain control, and assistance toward early mobilization) can also yield benefit toward preventing delirium.[3][21][53][54]
</p><p>Melatonin and other pharmacological agents have been studied for prevention of postoperative delirium, but evidence is not clear.[55][3] Avoidance or cautious use of benzodiazepines has been recommended for reducing the risk of delirium in critically ill individuals.[56] It is unclear if the medication donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, reduces delirium following surgery.[3] There is also no clear evidence to suggest that citicoline, methylprednisolone, or antipsychotic medications prevent delirium.[3]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment of delirium involves two main strategies: 1. identify and treat the underlying medical disorder or cause(s), and 2. manage behavioral disturbances. This involves optimizing oxygenation, hydration, nutrition, electrolytes/metabolites, comfort, mobilization, pain control, mental stress, therapeutic medication levels, and addressing any other possible predisposing and precipitating factors that might be disrupting brain function.[21]
</p><p>Non-pharmacologic interventions
</p><p>Such interventions are the first measures in managing active delirium and has many overlaps with delirium preventative strategies, including optimizing the hospital environment by reducing ambient noise, providing proper lighting for the time of day, minimizing room changes and restraint use.
</p><p>Family, friends, and other caregivers can offer frequent reassurance, tactile and verbal orientation, cognitive stimulation (e.g. regular visits, familiar objects, clocks, calendars, etc.), and means to stay engaged (e.g. making hearing aids and eyeglasses readily available).[21][52][57] Sometimes, verbal and non-verbal deescalation techniques may be required to offer reassurances and calm the person experiencing delirium.[52] Of note, severe agitation that endangers self or others may require physical restraints and professional supervision, but only as a last resort.[52][58]
</p><p>Another approached called the ""T-A-DA (tolerate, anticipate, don't agitate) method” can be an effective management technique for older people with delirium, where abnormal patient behaviors (including hallucinations and delusions) are tolerated and unchallenged, as long as caregiver and patient safety is not trespassed.[59] Implementation of this model may require a designated area in the hospital. All unnecessary attachments are removed to anticipate for greater mobility, and agitation is prevented by avoiding excessive reorientation/questioning.[59]
</p><p>Pharmacological interventions
</p><p>The treatment for delirium with medications depends on its cause.
</p><p>Low-dose haloperidol when used short term (one week or less) is the most studied and standard drug for delirium.[21][52] Evidence for efficacy of atypical antipsychotics (i.e. risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and quetiapine) is emerging, with the benefit for fewer side effects[21][60] Antipsychotics however are not supported for the treatment or prevention of delirium among those who are in hospital.[4]
</p><p>Benzodiazepines themselves can trigger or worsen delirium, and there is no reliable evidence for use in non-alcohol-related delirium.[22][63] If the delirium involves alcohol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, or  contraindications to antipsychotics (e.g. in Parkinson's disease or neuroleptic malignant syndrome), then benzodiazepines are recommended.[22] Similarly, people with dementia with Lewy bodies may have significant side effects to antipsychotics, and should either be treated with a none or small doses of benzodiazepines.[52]
</p><p>The antidepressant trazodone is occasionally used in the treatment of delirium, but it carries a risk of over-sedation, and its use has not been well studied.[21]
</p>"
42,delusion,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Psychotherapies that may be helpful in delusional disorder include individual psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and family therapy.
</p>"
43,dependence,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Addiction is a complex but treatable condition. It is characterized by compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use that persists even if the user is aware of severe adverse consequences. For some people, addiction becomes chronic, with periodic relapses even after long periods of abstinence. As a chronic, relapsing disease, addiction may require continued treatments to increase the intervals between relapses and diminish their intensity. While some with substance issues recover and lead fulfilling lives, others require ongoing additional support. The ultimate goal of addiction treatment is to enable an individual to manage their substance misuse; for some this may mean abstinence. Immediate goals are often to reduce substance abuse, improve the patient's ability to function, and minimize the medical and social complications of substance abuse and their addiction; this is called ""harm reduction"".
</p><p>Treatments for addiction vary widely according to the types of drugs involved, amount of drugs used, duration of the drug addiction, medical complications and the social needs of the individual. Determining the best type of recovery program for an addicted person depends on a number of factors, including: personality, drugs of choice, concept of spirituality or religion, mental or physical illness, and local availability and affordability of programs.
</p><p>Many different ideas circulate regarding what is considered a successful outcome in the recovery from addiction. Programs that emphasize controlled drinking exist for alcohol addiction. Opiate replacement therapy has been a medical standard of treatment for opioid addiction for many years.
</p><p>Treatments and attitudes toward addiction vary widely among different countries. In the US and developing countries, the goal of commissioners of treatment for drug dependence is generally total abstinence from all drugs. Other countries, particularly in Europe, argue the aims of treatment for drug dependence are more complex, with treatment aims including reduction in use to the point that drug use no longer interferes with normal activities such as work and family commitments; shifting the addict away from more dangerous routes of drug administration such as injecting to safer routes such as oral administration; reduction in crime committed by drug addicts; and treatment of other comorbid conditions such as AIDS, hepatitis and mental health disorders. These kinds of outcomes can be achieved without eliminating drug use completely. Drug treatment programs in Europe often report more favorable outcomes than those in the US because the criteria for measuring success are functional rather than abstinence-based.[24][25][26] The supporters of programs with total abstinence from drugs as a goal believe that enabling further drug use means prolonged drug use and risks an increase in addiction and complications from addiction.[27]
</p><h3>Residential[edit]</h3><p>Residential drug treatment can be broadly divided into two camps: 12-step programs and therapeutic communities. 12-step programs are a nonclinical support-group and faith-based approach to treating addiction. Therapy typically involves the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy, an approach that looks at the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviors, addressing the root cause of maladaptive behavior. Cognitive-behavioral therapy treats addiction as a behavior rather than a disease, and so is subsequently curable, or rather, unlearnable. Cognitive-behavioral therapy programs recognize that, for some individuals, controlled use is a more realistic possibility.[28]
</p><p>One of many recovery methods are 12-step recovery programs, with prominent examples including Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Drug Addicts Anonymous[29] and Pills Anonymous. They are commonly known and used for a variety of addictions for the individual addicted and the family of the individual. Substance-abuse rehabilitation (rehab) centers offer a residential treatment program for some of the more seriously addicted, in order to isolate the patient from drugs and interactions with other users and dealers. Outpatient clinics usually offer a combination of individual counseling and group counseling. Frequently, a physician or psychiatrist will prescribe medications in order to help patients cope with the side effects of their addiction. Medications can help immensely with anxiety and insomnia, can treat underlying mental disorders (cf. self-medication hypothesis, Khantzian 1997) such as depression, and can help reduce or eliminate withdrawal symptomology when withdrawing from physiologically addictive drugs. Some examples are using benzodiazepines for alcohol detoxification, which prevents delirium tremens and complications; using a slow taper of benzodiazepines or a taper of phenobarbital, sometimes including another antiepileptic agent such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or valproate, for withdrawal from barbiturates or benzodiazepines; using drugs such as baclofen to reduce cravings and propensity for relapse amongst addicts to any drug, especially effective in stimulant users, and alcoholics (in which it is nearly as effective as benzodiazepines in preventing complications); using clonidine, an alpha-agonist, and loperamide for opioid detoxification, for first-time users or those who wish to attempt an abstinence-based recovery (90% of opioid users relapse to active addiction within eight months or are multiple relapse patients); or replacing an opioid that is interfering with or destructive to a user's life, such as illicitly-obtained heroin, dilaudid, or oxycodone, with an opioid that can be administered legally, reduces or eliminates drug cravings, and does not produce a high, such as methadone or buprenorphine – opioid replacement therapy – which is the gold standard for treatment of opioid dependence in developed countries, reducing the risk and cost to both user and society more effectively than any other treatment modality (for opioid dependence), and shows the best short-term and long-term gains for the user, with the greatest longevity, least risk of fatality, greatest quality of life, and lowest risk of relapse and legal issues including arrest and incarceration.[citation needed]
</p><p>In a survey of treatment providers from three separate institutions, the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, Rational Recovery Systems and the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors, measuring the treatment provider's responses on the ""Spiritual Belief Scale"" (a scale measuring belief in the four spiritual characteristics of AA identified by Ernest Kurtz); the scores were found to explain 41% of the variance in the treatment provider's responses on the ""Addiction Belief Scale"" (a scale measuring adherence to the disease model or the free-will model of addiction).[30]
</p><h3>Behavioral programming[edit]</h3><p>Behavioral programming is considered critical in helping those with addictions achieve abstinence. From the applied behavior analysis literature and the behavioral psychology literature, several evidence based intervention programs have emerged: (1) behavioral marital therapy; (2) community reinforcement approach; (3) cue exposure therapy; and (4) contingency management strategies.[31][32] In addition, the same author suggest that Social skills training adjunctive to inpatient treatment of alcohol dependence is probably efficacious. Community reinforcement has both efficacy and effectiveness data.[33] In addition, behavioral treatment such as community reinforcement and family training (CRAFT) have helped family members to get their loved ones into treatment.[34][35] Motivational Intervention has also shown to be an effective treatment for substance dependence.
</p><h3>Alternative therapies[edit]</h3><p>Alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, are used by some practitioners to alleviate the symptoms of drug addiction. In 1997, the American Medical Association (AMA) adopted as policy the following statement after a report on a number of alternative therapies including acupuncture:
</p><blockquote>There is little evidence to confirm the safety or efficacy of most alternative therapies. Much of the information currently known about these therapies makes it clear that many have not been shown to be efficacious. Well-designed, stringently controlled research should be done to evaluate the efficacy of alternative therapies.[36]</blockquote><h2>Treatment and issues[edit]</h2><p>Medical professionals need to apply many techniques and approaches to help patients with substance related disorders. Using a psychodynamic approach is one of the techniques that psychologists use to solve addiction problems. In psychodynamic therapy, psychologists need to understand the conflicts and the needs of the addicted person, and also need to locate the defects of their ego and defense mechanisms. Using this approach alone has proven to be ineffective in solving addiction problems. Cognitive and behavioral techniques should be integrated with psychodynamic approaches to achieve effective treatment for substance related disorders.[37] Cognitive treatment requires psychologists to think deeply about what is happening in the brain of an addicted person. Cognitive psychologists should zoom in to neural functions of the brain and understand that drugs have been manipulating the dopamine reward center of the brain. From this particular state of thinking, cognitive psychologists need to find ways to change the thought process of the addicted person.[37]
</p><h3>Cognitive approach[edit]</h3><p>There are two routes typically applied to a cognitive approach to substance abuse: tracking the thoughts that pull patients to addiction and tracking the thoughts that prevent them from relapsing. Behavioral techniques have the widest application in treating substance related disorders. Behavioral psychologists can use the techniques of ""aversion therapy"", based on the findings of Pavlov's classical conditioning. It uses the principle of pairing abused substances with unpleasant stimuli or conditions; for example, pairing pain, electrical shock, or nausea with alcohol consumption.[37] The use of medications may also be used in this approach, such as using disulfiram to pair unpleasant effects with the thought of alcohol use. Psychologists tend to use an integration of all these approaches to produce reliable and effective treatment. With the advanced clinical use of medications, biological treatment is now considered to be one of the most efficient interventions that psychologists may use as treatment for those with substance dependence.[37]
</p><h3>Medicinal approach[edit]</h3><p>Another approach is to use medicines that interfere with the functions of the drugs in the brain. Similarly, one can also substitute the misused substance with a weaker, safer version to slowly taper the patient off of their dependence. Such is the case with Suboxone in the context of opioid dependence. These approaches are aimed at the process of detoxification. Medical professionals weigh the consequences of withdrawal symptoms against the risk of staying dependent on these substances. These withdrawal symptoms can be very difficult and painful times for patients. Most will have steps in place to handle severe withdrawal symptoms, either through behavioral therapy or other medications. Biological intervention should be combined with behavioral therapy approaches and other non-pharmacological techniques. Group therapies including anonymity, teamwork and sharing concerns of daily life among people who also suffer from substance dependence issues can have a great impact on outcomes. However, these programs proved to be more effective and influential on persons who did not reach levels of serious dependence.[37]
</p>"
44,depression mental,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Depressed mood may not require professional treatment, and may be a normal temporary reaction to life events, a symptom of some medical condition, or a side effect of some drugs or medical treatments. A prolonged depressed mood, especially in combination with other symptoms, may lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric or medical condition which may benefit from treatment. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.[36] Physical activity can have a protective effect against the emergence of depression.[37]
</p><p>Reminiscence of old and fond memories is another alternative form of treatment, especially for the elderly who have lived longer and have more experiences in life. It is a method that causes a person to recollect memories of their own life, leading to a process of self-recognition and identifying familiar stimuli. By maintaining one’s personal past and identity, it is a technique that stimulates people to view their lives in a more objective and balanced way, causing them to pay attention to positive information in their life stories, which would successfully reduce depressive mood levels.[38]
</p>"
45,depressive disorder,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>Preventative efforts may result in decreases in rates of the condition of between 22 and 38%.[133] Eating large amounts of fish may also reduce the risk.[134]
</p><p>Behavioral interventions, such as interpersonal therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, are effective at preventing new onset depression.[133][135][136] Because such interventions appear to be most effective when delivered to individuals or small groups, it has been suggested that they may be able to reach their large target audience most efficiently through the Internet.[137]
</p><p>However, an earlier meta-analysis found preventive programs with a competence-enhancing component to be superior to behavior-oriented programs overall, and found behavioral programs to be particularly unhelpful for older people, for whom social support programs were uniquely beneficial. In addition, the programs that best prevented depression comprised more than eight sessions, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were provided by a combination of lay and professional workers, had a high-quality research design, reported attrition rates, and had a well-defined intervention.[138]
</p><p>The Netherlands mental health care system provides preventive interventions, such as the ""Coping with Depression"" course (CWD) for people with sub-threshold depression. The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.[135][139]
</p><h2>Management</h2><div>Main article: Management of depression</div><p>The three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:
</p><dl>People with a history of moderate or severe depression
Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period
As a second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions
As a first line treatment for moderate or severe depression.</dl><p>The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants.[140]
</p><p>American Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, exercise, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.[141] There is evidence that collaborative care by a team of health care practitioners produces better results than routine single-practitioner care.[142]
</p><p>Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition.[143] A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of psychological versus medical therapy in children.[144]
</p><h3>Lifestyle</h3><div>Further information: Neurobiological effects of physical exercise § Major depressive disorder</div><p>Physical exercise is recommended for management of mild depression,[145] and has a moderate effect on symptoms.[5] Exercise has also been found to be effective for (unipolar) major depression.[146] It is equivalent to the use of medications or psychological therapies in most people.[5] In older people it does appear to decrease depression.[147] Exercise may be recommended to people who are willing, motivated, and physically healthy enough to participate in an exercise program as treatment.[146]
</p><p>There is a small amount of evidence that skipping a night's sleep may improve depressive symptoms, with the effects usually showing up within a day. This effect is usually temporary. Besides sleepiness, this method can cause a side effect of mania or hypomania.[148]
</p><p>In observational studies, smoking cessation has benefits in depression as large as or larger than those of medications.[149]
</p><p>Besides exercise, sleep and diet may play a role in depression, and interventions in these areas may be an effective add-on to conventional methods.[150]
</p><h3>Counseling</h3><p>Psychotherapy can be delivered to individuals, groups, or families by mental health professionals. A 2015 review found that cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be similar to antidepressant medication in terms of effect.[151] A 2012 review found psychotherapy to be better than no treatment but not other treatments.[152] With more complex and chronic forms of depression, a combination of medication and psychotherapy may be used.[153][154] A 2014 Cochrane review found that work-directed interventions combined with clinical interventions helped to reduce sick days taken by people with depression.[155] There is moderate-quality evidence that psychological therapies are a useful addition to standard antidepressant treatment of treatment-resistant depression in the short term.[156]
</p><p>Psychotherapy has been shown to be effective in older people.[157][158] Successful psychotherapy appears to reduce the recurrence of depression even after it has been terminated or replaced by occasional booster sessions.
</p><h4>Cognitive behavioral therapy</h4><div>See also: Behavioral theories of depression</div><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) currently has the most research evidence for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, and CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are preferred therapies for adolescent depression.[159] In people under 18, according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, medication should be offered only in conjunction with a psychological therapy, such as CBT, interpersonal therapy, or family therapy.[160] Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to reduce the number of sick days taken by people with depression, when used in conjunction with primary care.[155]
</p><p>The most-studied form of psychotherapy for depression is CBT, which teaches clients to challenge self-defeating, but enduring ways of thinking (cognitions) and change counter-productive behaviors. Research beginning in the mid-1990s suggested that CBT could perform as well as or better than antidepressants in patients with moderate to severe depression.[161][162] CBT may be effective in depressed adolescents,[163] although its effects on severe episodes are not definitively known.[164] Several variables predict success for cognitive behavioral therapy in adolescents: higher levels of rational thoughts, less hopelessness, fewer negative thoughts, and fewer cognitive distortions.[165] CBT is particularly beneficial in preventing relapse.[166][167]
</p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy and occupational programs (including modification of work activities and assistance) have been shown to be effective in reducing sick days taken by workers with depression.[155]
</p><h4>Variants</h4><p>Several variants of cognitive behavior therapy have been used in those with depression, the most notable being rational emotive behavior therapy,[168] and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.[169] Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs may reduce depression symptoms.[170][171] Mindfulness programs also appear to be a promising intervention in youth.[172]
</p><h4>Psychoanalysis</h4><p>Psychoanalysis is a school of thought, founded by Sigmund Freud, which emphasizes the resolution of unconscious mental conflicts.[173] Psychoanalytic techniques are used by some practitioners to treat clients presenting with major depression.[174] A more widely practiced therapy, called psychodynamic psychotherapy, is in the tradition of psychoanalysis but less intensive, meeting once or twice a week. It also tends to focus more on the person's immediate problems, and has an additional social and interpersonal focus.[175] In a meta-analysis of three controlled trials of Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy, this modification was found to be as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression.[176]
</p><h3>Antidepressants</h3><div> Sertraline (Zoloft) is used primarily to treat major depression in adults.</div><p>Conflicting results have arisen from studies that look at the effectiveness of antidepressants in people with acute, mild to moderate depression.[177] Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic (dysthymia) or severe.
</p><p>While small benefits were found, researchers Irving Kirsch and Thomas Moore state they may be due to issues with the trials rather than a true effect of the medication.[178] In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.[14] Similar results were obtained in a meta-analysis by Fornier.[13]
</p><p>A review commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) concluded that there is strong evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as escitalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline, have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression.[179] Similarly, a Cochrane systematic review of clinical trials of the generic tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline concluded that there is strong evidence that its efficacy is superior to placebo.[180]
</p><p>In 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012. The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.[13]
</p><p>To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50–75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to remission.[141] Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence,[141] and even up to one year of continuation is recommended.[181] People with chronic depression may need to take medication indefinitely to avoid relapse.[21]
</p><p>SSRIs are the primary medications prescribed, owing to their relatively mild side-effects, and because they are less toxic in overdose than other antidepressants.[182] People who do not respond to one SSRI can be switched to another antidepressant, and this results in improvement in almost 50% of cases.[183] Another option is to switch to the atypical antidepressant bupropion.[184] Venlafaxine, an antidepressant with a different mechanism of action, may be modestly more effective than SSRIs.[185] However, venlafaxine is not recommended in the UK as a first-line treatment because of evidence suggesting its risks may outweigh benefits,[186] and it is specifically discouraged in children and adolescents.[187][188]
</p><p>For children, some research has supported the use of the SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine.[189] The benefit however appears to be slight in children,[189][190] while other antidepressants have not been shown to be effective.[189] Medications are not recommended in children with mild disease.[191] There is also insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness in those with depression complicated by dementia.[192] Any antidepressant can cause low blood sodium levels;[193] nevertheless, it has been reported more often with SSRIs.[182] It is not uncommon for SSRIs to cause or worsen insomnia; the sedating atypical antidepressant mirtazapine can be used in such cases.[194][195]
</p><p>Irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, an older class of antidepressants, have been plagued by potentially life-threatening dietary and drug interactions. They are still used only rarely, although newer and better-tolerated agents of this class have been developed.[196] The safety profile is different with reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as moclobemide, where the risk of serious dietary interactions is negligible and dietary restrictions are less strict.[197]
</p><p>For children, adolescents, and probably young adults between 18 and 24 years old, there is a higher risk of both suicidal ideations and suicidal behavior in those treated with SSRIs.[198][199] For adults, it is unclear whether SSRIs affect the risk of suicidality. One review found no connection;[200] another an increased risk;[201] and a third no risk in those 25–65 years old and a decreased risk in those more than 65.[202] A black box warning was introduced in the United States in 2007 on SSRIs and other antidepressant medications due to the increased risk of suicide in patients younger than 24 years old.[203] Similar precautionary notice revisions were implemented by the Japanese Ministry of Health.[204]
</p><h3>Other medications</h3><p>There is some evidence that omega-3 fatty acids fish oil supplements containing high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are effective in the treatment of, but not the prevention of major depression.[205] However, a Cochrane review determined there was insufficient high quality evidence to suggest omega-3 fatty acids were effective in depression.[206] There is limited evidence that vitamin D supplementation is of value in alleviating the symptoms of depression in individuals who are vitamin D-deficient.[207] There is some preliminary evidence that COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, have a beneficial effect on major depression.[208] Lithium appears effective at lowering the risk of suicide in those with bipolar disorder and unipolar depression to nearly the same levels as the general population.[209] There is a narrow range of effective and safe dosages of lithium thus close monitoring may be needed.[210] Low-dose thyroid hormone may be added to existing antidepressants to treat persistent depression symptoms in people who have tried multiple courses of medication.[211] Limited evidence suggests stimulants, such as amphetamine and modafinil, may be effective in the short term, or as adjuvant therapy.[212][213] Also, it is suggested that folate supplements may have a role in depression management.[214] There is tentative evidence for benefit from testosterone in males.[215]
</p><h3>Electroconvulsive therapy</h3><p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a standard psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from psychiatric illnesses.[216]:1880 ECT is used with informed consent[217] as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder.[218]
</p><p>A round of ECT is effective for about 50% of people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, whether it is unipolar or bipolar.[219] Follow-up treatment is still poorly studied, but about half of people who respond relapse within twelve months.[220]
</p><p>Aside from effects in the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia.[221]:259 Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss.[218][222] ECT is considered one of the least harmful treatment options available for severely depressed pregnant women.[223]
</p><p>A usual course of ECT involves multiple administrations, typically given two or three times per week, until the patient is no longer suffering symptoms. ECT is administered under anesthesia with a muscle relaxant.[224] Electroconvulsive therapy can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, frequency of treatments, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus. These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission. After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some patients receive maintenance ECT.[218]
</p><p>ECT appears to work in the short term via an anticonvulsant effect mostly in the frontal lobes, and longer term via neurotrophic effects primarily in the medial temporal lobe.[225]
</p><h3>Transcranial magnetic stimulation</h3><p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or deep transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive method used to stimulate small regions of the brain.[226] TMS was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (trMDD) in 2008[227] and as of 2014 evidence supports that it is probably effective.[228] The American Psychiatric Association[229] the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders,[230] and the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists have endorsed TMS for trMDD.[231]
</p><h3>Other</h3><p>Bright light therapy reduces depression symptom severity, with benefit for both seasonal affective disorder and for nonseasonal depression, and an effect similar to those for conventional antidepressants. For nonseasonal depression, adding light therapy to the standard antidepressant treatment was not effective.[232] For nonseasonal depression, where light was used mostly in combination with antidepressants or wake therapy, a moderate effect was found, with response better than control treatment in high-quality studies, in studies that applied morning light treatment, and with people who respond to total or partial sleep deprivation.[233] Both analyses noted poor quality, short duration, and small size of most of the reviewed studies. There is insufficient evidence for Reiki[234] and dance movement therapy in depression.[235]
</p><h2>Research</h2><p>Trials are looking at the effects of botulinum toxins on depression. The idea is that the drug is used to make the person look less frowning and that this stops the negative facial feedback from the face.[312] In 2015 results showed, however, that the partly positive effects that had been observed until then could have been due to placebo effects.[313]
</p><p>MRI scans of patients with depression have revealed a number of differences in brain structure compared to those who are not depressed. Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies in major depression reported that, compared to controls, depressed patients had increased volume of the lateral ventricles and adrenal gland and smaller volumes of the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, and frontal lobe (including the orbitofrontal cortex and gyrus rectus).[314][315] Hyperintensities have been associated with patients with a late age of onset, and have led to the development of the theory of vascular depression.[316]
</p><p>In 2018, following several smaller studies investigating psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of depression,[317][318] the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a Phase 2 study on psilocybin in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression and granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation.[319]

46,diabetes,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div>See also: Prevention of diabetes mellitus type 2</div><p>There is no known preventive measure for type 1 diabetes.[2] Type 2 diabetes—which accounts for 85–90% of all cases worldwide—can often be prevented or delayed by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity, and eating a healthy diet.[2] Higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%.[71] Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish.[72] Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent diabetes.[72] Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well.[73]
</p><p>The relationship between type 2 diabetes and the main modifiable risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. There is growing evidence that the underlying determinants of diabetes are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change: globalization, urbanization, population aging, and the general health policy environment.[74]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Diabetes management</div><div>Play media Overview of the management of diabetes</div><p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease, for which there is no known cure except in very specific situations.[75] Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal, without causing low blood sugar. This can usually be accomplished with a healthy diet, exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type 1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type 2 diabetes).
</p><p>Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.[76][77] The goal of treatment is an HbA1C level of 6.5%, but should not be lower than that, and may be set higher.[78] Attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the negative effects of diabetes. These include smoking, elevated cholesterol levels, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of regular exercise.[78] Specialized footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of ulceration, or re-ulceration, in at-risk diabetic feet. Evidence for the efficacy of this remains equivocal, however.[79]
</p><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><div>See also: Diabetic diet</div><p>People with diabetes can benefit from education about the disease and treatment, good nutrition to achieve a normal body weight, and exercise, with the goal of keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels within acceptable bounds. In addition, given the associated higher risks of cardiovascular disease, lifestyle modifications are recommended to control blood pressure.[80][81]
</p><p>No single dietary pattern is best for all people with diabetes. For overweight people with type 2 diabetes, any diet that achieves weight loss is effective.[82][83]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><h4>Glucose control[edit]</h4><div>See also: Anti-diabetic medication</div><p>Medications used to treat diabetes do so by lowering blood sugar levels. There is broad consensus that when people with diabetes maintain tight glucose control (also called ""tight glycemic control"") – keeping the glucose levels in their blood within normal ranges – that they experience fewer complications like kidney problems and eye problems.[84][85] There is however debate as to whether this is cost effective for people later in life.[86]
</p><p>There are a number of different classes of anti-diabetic medications. Some are available by mouth, such as metformin, while others are only available by injection such as GLP-1 agonists. Type 1 diabetes can only be treated with insulin, typically with a combination of regular and NPH insulin, or synthetic insulin analogs.[citation needed]
</p><p>Metformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment for type 2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.[6] It works by decreasing the liver's production of glucose.[87] Several other groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, may also decrease blood sugar in type II DM. These include agents that increase insulin release, agents that decrease absorption of sugar from the intestines, and agents that make the body more sensitive to insulin.[87] When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.[6] Doses of insulin are then increased to effect.[6][88]
</p><h4>Blood pressure[edit]</h4><p>Since cardiovascular disease is a serious complication associated with diabetes, some have recommended blood pressure levels below 130/80 mmHg.[89] However, evidence supports less than or equal to somewhere between 140/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg; the only additional benefit found for blood pressure targets beneath this range was an isolated decrease in stroke risk, and this was accompanied by an increased risk of other serious adverse events.[90][91] A 2016 review found potential harm to treating lower than 140 mmHg.[92] Among medications that lower blood pressure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improve outcomes in those with DM while the similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not.[93] Aspirin is also recommended for people with cardiovascular problems, however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.[94]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Weight loss surgery in those with obesity and type two diabetes is often an effective measure.[14] Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medications following surgery[95] and long-term mortality is decreased.[96] There is, however, a short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery.[97] The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear.[96] It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control.[98]
</p><p>A pancreas transplant is occasionally considered for people with type 1 diabetes who have severe complications of their disease, including end stage kidney disease requiring kidney transplantation.[99]
</p><h3>Support[edit]</h3><p>In countries using a general practitioner system, such as the United Kingdom, care may take place mainly outside hospitals, with hospital-based specialist care used only in case of complications, difficult blood sugar control, or research projects. In other circumstances, general practitioners and specialists share care in a team approach. Home telehealth support can be an effective management technique.[100]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Inhalable insulin has been developed.[125] The original products were withdrawn due to side effects.[125] Afrezza, under development by the pharmaceuticals company MannKind Corporation, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for general sale in June 2014.[126] An advantage to inhaled insulin is that it may be more convenient and easy to use.[127]
</p><p>Transdermal insulin in the form of a cream has been developed and trials are being conducted on people with type 2 diabetes.[128][129]
</p><h3>Major clinical trials[edit]</h3><p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was a clinical study conducted by the United States National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993. Test subjects all had diabetes mellitus type 1 and were randomized to a tight glycemic arm and a control arm with the standard of care at the time; people were followed for an average of seven years, and people in the treatment had dramatically lower rates of diabetic complications.  It was as a landmark study at the time, and significantly changed the management of all forms of diabetes.[86][130][131]
</p><p>The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a clinical study conducted by Z that was published in The Lancet in 1998. Around 3,800 people with type 2 diabetes were followed for an average of ten years, and were treated with tight glucose control or the standard of care, and again the treatment arm had far better outcomes.  This confirmed the importance of tight glucose control, as well as blood pressure control, for people with this condition.[86][132][133]
</p>"
47,diverticulitis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Most cases of simple, uncomplicated diverticulitis respond to conservative therapy with bowel rest.
</p><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>People may be placed on a low fibre diet.[19] It was previously thought that a low-fibre diet gives the colon adequate time to heal. Evidence tends to run counter to this, with a 2011 review finding no evidence for the superiority of low fibre diets in treating diverticular disease, and that a high-fibre diet may prevent diverticular disease.[20] A systematic review published in 2012 found no high-quality studies, but found that some studies and guidelines favour a high-fibre diet for the treatment of symptomatic disease.[21] While it has been suggested that probiotics may be useful for treatment, the evidence currently neither supports nor refutes this claim.[22]
</p><h3>Antibiotics[edit]</h3><p>The use of antibiotics in mild cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis is supported with only ""sparse and of low-quality"" evidence, with no evidence supporting their routine use.[23][17] In spite of this, antibiotics are recommended by several current guidelines. With CT scan evidence of abscess, fistula, or intestinal rupture with peritonitis, antibiotics are recommended and routinely used.
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><h4>Indications[edit]</h4><p>Indications for surgery are abscess or fistula formation; and intestinal rupture with peritonitis.[11] These, however, rarely occur.[11] Surgery for abscess or fistula is indicated either urgently or electively. The timing of the elective surgery is determined by evaluating factors such as the stage of the disease, the age of the person, their general medical condition, the severity and frequency of the attacks, and whether symptoms persist after the first acute episode. In most cases, elective surgery is deemed to be indicated when the risks of the surgery are less than the risks of the complications of the diverticulitis. Elective surgery is not indicated until at least six weeks after recovery from the acute event.[24] Emergency surgery is indicated for intestinal rupture with peritonitis.[25]
</p><h4>Technique[edit]</h4><p>The first surgical approach consists of resection and primary anastomosis. This first stage of surgery is performed on patients if they have a well-vascularized, nonedematous and tension-free bowel. The proximal margin should be an area of pliable colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. The distal margin should extend to the upper third of the rectum where the taenia coalesces. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed, since diverticula proximal to the descending or sigmoid colon are unlikely to result in further symptoms.[26]
</p><h4>Approach[edit]</h4><p>Diverticulitis surgery consists of a bowel resection with or without colostomy. Either may be done by the traditional laparotomy or by laparoscopic surgery.[27] The traditional bowel resection is made using an open surgical approach, called colectomy. During a colectomy the patient is placed under general anesthesia. A surgeon performing a colectomy will make a lower midline incision in the abdomen or a lateral lower transverse incision. The diseased section of the large intestine is removed, and then the two healthy ends are sewn or stapled back together. A colostomy may be performed when the bowel has to be relieved of its normal digestive work as it heals. A colostomy implies creating a temporary opening of the colon on the skin surface, and the end of the colon is passed through the abdominal wall with a removable bag attached to it. The waste is collected in the bag.[28]
</p><p>However, most surgeons prefer performing the bowel resection laparoscopically, mainly because postoperative pain is reduced with faster recovery. The laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure in which three to four smaller incisions are made in the abdomen or navel. Alternately, laparoscopic sigmoid resection (LSR) compared to open sigmoid resection (OSR) showed that LSR is not superior over OSR  for acute symptomatic diverticulitis. Furthermore, laparoscopic lavage was as safe as resection for perforated diverticulitis with peritonitis.[29]
</p><h4>Maneuvers[edit]</h4><p>All colon surgery involves only three maneuvers that may vary in complexity depending on the region of the bowel and the nature of the disease. The maneuvers are the retraction of the colon, the division of the attachments to the colon and the dissection of the mesentery.[30] After the resection of the colon, the surgeon normally divides the attachments to the liver and the small intestine. After the mesenteric vessels are dissected, the colon is divided with special surgical staplers that close off the bowel while cutting between the staple lines.
</p><h4>Bowel resection with colostomy[edit]</h4><p>When excessive inflammation of the colon renders primary bowel resection too risky, bowel resection with colostomy remains an option. Also known as the Hartmann's operation, this is a more complicated surgery typically reserved for life-threatening cases. The bowel resection with colostomy implies a temporary colostomy which is followed by a second operation to reverse the colostomy. The surgeon makes an opening in the abdominal wall (a colostomy) which helps clear the infection and inflammation. The colon is brought through the opening and all waste is collected in an external bag.[31]
</p><p>The colostomy is usually temporary, but it may be permanent, depending on the severity of the case.[32] In most cases several months later, after the inflammation has healed, the patient undergoes another major surgery, during which the surgeon rejoins the colon and rectum and reverses the colostomy.
</p>"
48,diverticulosis,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Many people with diverticulosis have minimal to no symptoms, and do not require any specific treatment. Colonic stimulants should be avoided. Treatments, like some colon cleansers, that cause hard stools, constipation, and straining, are not recommended.[citation needed]
</p><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>A high-fiber diet and fiber supplements are advisable to prevent constipation.[23][24] The American Dietetic Association recommends 20–35 grams each day. Wheat bran has been shown to reduce intra colonic pressure.[25][26]
</p><p>The US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) says foods such as nuts, popcorn hulls, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, caraway seeds, and sesame seeds have traditionally been labeled as problem foods for people with this condition; however, no scientific data exists to prove this hypothesis. The seeds in tomatoes, zucchini, cucumbers, strawberries, raspberries, and poppy seeds, are not considered harmful by the NIDDK.[2]
</p><p>One study found that nuts and popcorn do not contribute positively or negatively to patients with diverticulosis or diverticular complications.[27][28]
</p><h3>Complications[edit]</h3><p>Complicated diverticulosis requires treatment of the complication. These complications are often grouped under a single diagnosis of diverticulitis and require skilled medical care of the infection, bleeding and perforation which may include intensive antibiotic treatment, intravenous fluids and surgery. Complications are more common in patients who are taking NSAIDs or aspirin. As diverticulosis occurs in an older population such complications are serious events.[citation needed]
</p>"
49,edema pulmonary,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>In those with underlying heart disease, effective control of congestive symptoms prevents pulmonary edema.[citation needed]
</p><p>Dexamethasone is in widespread use for the prevention of high altitude pulmonary edema. Sildenafil is used as a preventive treatment for altitude-induced pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension,[19][20] the mechanism of action is via phosphodiesterase inhibition which raises cGMP, resulting in pulmonary arterial vasodilation and inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation.[21]  While this effect has only recently been discovered, sildenafil is already becoming an accepted treatment for this condition, in particular in situations where the standard treatment of rapid descent has been delayed for some reason.[22]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>The initial management of pulmonary edema, irrespective of the type or cause, is supporting vital functions. Therefore, if the level of consciousness is decreased it may be required to proceed to tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to prevent airway compromise. Hypoxia (abnormally low oxygen levels) may require supplementary oxygen, but if this is insufficient then again mechanical ventilation may be required to prevent complications.[citation needed] Treatment of the underlying cause is the next priority; pulmonary edema secondary to infection, for instance, would require the administration of appropriate antibiotics.[citation needed]
</p><h3>Cardiogenic pulmonary edema[edit]</h3><p>Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema often responds rapidly to medical treatment.[23] Positioning upright may relieve symptoms. Loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide are administered, often together with morphine or diamorphine to reduce respiratory distress.[23] Both diuretics and morphine may have vasodilator effects, but specific vasodilators may be used (particularly intravenous glyceryl trinitrate or ISDN) provided the blood pressure is adequate.[23]
</p><p>Continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP/NIPPV) has been demonstrated to reduce the need of mechanical ventilation in people with severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and may reduce mortality.[24]
</p><p>It is possible for cardiogenic pulmonary edema to occur together with cardiogenic shock, in which the cardiac output is insufficient to sustain an adequate blood pressure. This can be treated with inotropic agents or by intra-aortic balloon pump, but this is regarded as temporary treatment while the underlying cause is addressed.[23]
</p>"
50,effusion pericardial,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the heart impairment. Pericardial effusion due to a viral infection usually goes away within a few weeks without the treatment. Some pericardial effusions remain small and never need treatment. If the pericardial effusion is due to a condition such as lupus, treatment with anti-inflammatory medications may help. If the effusion is compromising heart function and causing cardiac tamponade, it will need to be drained, most commonly by a needle inserted through the chest wall and into the pericardial space called pericardiocentesis. A drainage tube is often left in place for several days. In some cases, surgical drainage may be required by cutting through the pericardium creating a pericardial window.
</p>"
51,embolism pulmonary,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div>Further information: Thrombosis prophylaxis</div><p>Pulmonary embolism may be preventable in those with risk factors. People admitted to hospital may receive preventative medication, including unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux, and anti-thrombosis stockings to reduce the risk of a DVT in the leg that could dislodge and migrate to the lungs.[69]
</p><p>Following the completion of warfarin in those with prior PE, long-term aspirin is useful to prevent recurrence.[70]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Anticoagulant therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Acutely, supportive treatments, such as oxygen or analgesia, may be required. People are often admitted to hospital in the early stages of treatment, and tend to remain under inpatient care until the INR has reached therapeutic levels. Increasingly, however, low-risk cases are managed at home in a fashion already common in the treatment of DVT.[70][71] Evidence to support one approach versus the other is weak.[72]
</p><h3>Anticoagulation[edit]</h3><p>Usually, anticoagulant therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux is administered initially, while warfarin, acenocoumarol, or phenprocoumon therapy is commenced (this may take several days, usually while the patient is in the hospital). LMWH may reduce bleeding among people with pulmonary embolism as compared to UFH according to a systematic review of randomized controlled trials by the Cochrane Collaboration.[73] According to the same review, LMWH reduced the incidence of recurrent thrombotic complications and reduced thrombus size when compared to heparin. There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with unfractionated heparin.
</p><p>Warfarin therapy often requires a frequent dose adjustment and monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR). In PE, INRs between 2.0 and 3.0 are generally considered ideal. If another episode of PE occurs under warfarin treatment, the INR window may be increased to e.g. 2.5–3.5 (unless there are contraindications) or anticoagulation may be changed to a different anticoagulant e.g. LMWH.[citation needed]
</p><p>In patients with an underlying malignancy, therapy with a course of LMWH is favored over warfarin; it is continued for six months, at which point a decision should be reached whether ongoing treatment is required.[74]
</p><p>Similarly, pregnant women are often maintained on low molecular weight heparin until at least six weeks after delivery to avoid the known teratogenic effects of warfarin, especially in the early stages of pregnancy.[55][75]
</p><p>Warfarin therapy is usually continued for 3–6 months, or ""lifelong"" if there have been previous DVTs or PEs, or none of the usual risk factors is present. An abnormal D-dimer level at the end of treatment might signal the need for continued treatment among patients with a first unprovoked pulmonary embolus.[76] For those with small PEs (known as subsegmental PEs) the effects of anticoagulation is unknown as it has not been properly studied as of 2014.[77]
</p><h3>Thrombolysis[edit]</h3><p>Massive PE causing hemodynamic instability (shock and/or low blood pressure, defined as a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or a pressure drop of 40 mmHg for >15 min if not caused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolemia or sepsis) is an indication for thrombolysis, the enzymatic destruction of the clot with medication. In this situation, it is the best available treatment in those without contraindications and is supported by clinical guidelines.[26][74][78] It is also recommended in those in cardiac arrest with a known PE.[79]
</p><p>Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is a new technique found to be relatively safe and effective for massive PEs. This involves accessing the venous system by placing a catheter into a vein in the groin and guiding it through the veins by using fluoroscopic imaging until it is located next to the PE in the lung circulation. Medication that breaks up blood clots is released through the catheter so that its highest concentration is directly next to the pulmonary embolus. CDT is performed by  interventional radiologists or vascular surgeons, and in medical centers that offer CDT, it may be offered as a first-line treatment.[80] Catheter-based ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis is being investigated.[81]
</p><p>The use of thrombolysis in non-massive PEs is still debated.[82][needs update][83] Some have found that the treatment decreases the risk of death and increases the risk of bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage.[84] Others have found no decrease in the risk of death.[83]
</p><h3>Inferior vena cava filter[edit]</h3><div> Used inferior vena cava filter.</div><p>There are two situations when an inferior vena cava filter is considered advantageous, and those are if anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated (e.g. shortly after a major operation), or a person has a pulmonary embolus in spite of being anticoagulated.[74] In these instances, it may be implanted to prevent new or existing DVTs from entering the pulmonary artery and combining with an existing blockage.[74] In spite of the device's theoretical advantage of preventing pulmonary emboli, there is a lack of evidence supporting its effectiveness.[85]
</p><p>Inferior vena cava filters should be removed as soon as it becomes safe to start using anticoagulation.[74] Although modern filters are meant to be retrievable, complications may prevent some from being removed. The long-term safety profile of permanently leaving a filter inside the body is not known.[85]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Surgical management of acute pulmonary embolism (pulmonary thrombectomy) is uncommon and has largely been abandoned because of poor long-term outcomes. However, recently, it has gone through a resurgence with the revision of the surgical technique and is thought to benefit certain people.[86] Chronic pulmonary embolism leading to pulmonary hypertension (known as chronic thromboembolic hypertension) is treated with a surgical procedure known as a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.
</p>"
52,emphysema pulmonary,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Most cases of COPD are potentially preventable through decreasing exposure to smoke and improving air quality.[11] Annual influenza vaccinations in those with COPD reduce exacerbations, hospitalizations and death.[70][71] Pneumococcal vaccination may also be beneficial.[70] Eating a diet high in beta-carotene may help but taking supplements does not seem to.[72] A review of an oral Haemophilus influenzae vaccine found 1.6 exacerbations per year as opposed to a baseline of 2.1 in those with COPD.[73] This small reduction was not deemed significant.[73]
</p><h3>Smoking cessation[edit]</h3><p>Keeping people from starting smoking is a key aspect of preventing COPD.[74] The policies of governments, public health agencies, and antismoking organizations can reduce smoking rates by discouraging people from starting and encouraging people to stop smoking.[75] Smoking bans in public areas and places of work are important measures to decrease exposure to secondhand smoke, and while many places have instituted bans, more are recommended.[11]
</p><p>In those who smoke, stopping smoking is the only measure shown to slow down the worsening of COPD.[76][77] Even at a late stage of the disease, it can reduce the rate of worsening lung function and delay the onset of disability and death.[78] Often, several attempts are required before long-term abstinence is achieved.[75] Attempts over 5 years lead to success in nearly 40% of people.[79]
</p><p>Some smokers can achieve long-term smoking cessation through willpower alone. Smoking, however, is highly addictive,[80] and many smokers need further support. The chance of quitting is improved with social support, engagement in a smoking cessation program, and the use of medications such as nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, or varenicline.[75][77][79] Combining smoking-cessation medication with behavioral therapy is more than twice as likely to be effective in helping people with COPD stop smoking, compared with behavioral therapy alone.[81]
</p><h3>Occupational health[edit]</h3><p>A number of measures have been taken to reduce the likelihood that workers in at-risk industries—such as coal mining, construction, and stonemasonry—will develop COPD.[11] Examples of these measures include the creation of public policy,[11] education of workers and management about the risks, promoting smoking cessation, checking workers for early signs of COPD, use of respirators, and dust control.[82][83] Effective dust control can be achieved by improving ventilation, using water sprays and by using mining techniques that minimize dust generation.[84] If a worker develops COPD, further lung damage can be reduced by avoiding ongoing dust exposure, for example by changing the work role.[85]
</p><h3>Air pollution[edit]</h3><p>Both indoor and outdoor air quality can be improved, which may prevent COPD or slow the worsening of existing disease.[11] This may be achieved by public policy efforts, cultural changes, and personal involvement.[86]
</p><p>A number of developed countries have successfully improved outdoor air quality through regulations. This has resulted in improvements in the lung function of their populations.[11] Those with COPD may experience fewer symptoms if they stay indoors on days when outdoor air quality is poor.[5]
</p><p>One key effort is to reduce exposure to smoke from cooking and heating fuels through improved ventilation of homes and better stoves and chimneys.[86] Proper stoves may improve indoor air quality by 85%. Using alternative energy sources such as solar cooking and electrical heating is also effective. Using fuels such as kerosene or coal might be less bad than traditional biomass such as wood or dung.[11]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>No cure for COPD is known, but the symptoms are treatable and its progression can be delayed.[74] The major goals of management are to reduce risk factors, manage stable COPD, prevent and treat acute exacerbations, and manage associated illnesses.[5] The only measures that have been shown to reduce mortality are smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen.[87] Stopping smoking decreases the risk of death by 18%.[2] Other recommendations include influenza vaccination once a year, pneumococcal vaccination once every five years, and reduction in exposure to environmental air pollution.[2] In those with advanced disease, palliative care may reduce symptoms, with morphine improving the feelings of shortness of breath.[88] Noninvasive ventilation may be used to support breathing.[88] Providing people with a personalized action plan, an educational session, and support for use of their action plan in the event of an exacerbation, reduces the number of hospital visits and encourages early treatment of exacerbations.[89] When self-management interventions, such as taking corticosteroids and using supplemental oxygen, is combined with action plans, health-related quality of life is improved compared to usual care.[90]
</p><h3>Exercise[edit]</h3><p>Pulmonary rehabilitation is a program of exercise, disease management, and counseling, coordinated to benefit the individual.[91] In those who have had a recent exacerbation, pulmonary rehabilitation appears to improve the overall quality of life and the ability to exercise.[92][93] If pulmonary rehabilitation improves mortality rates or hospital readmission rates is unclear.[92] Pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to improve the sense of control a person has over their disease, as well as their emotions.[94]
</p><p>The optimal exercise routine, use of noninvasive ventilation during exercise, and intensity of exercise suggested for people with COPD, is unknown.[93][95][96] Performing endurance arm exercises improves arm movement for people with COPD, and may result in a small improvement in breathlessness.[97] Performing arm exercises alone does not appear to improve quality of life.[97] Breathing exercises in and of themselves appear to have a limited role.[22] Pursed lip breathing exercises may be useful.[21][22] Tai chi exercises appear to be safe to practice for people with COPD, and may be beneficial for pulmonary function and pulmonary capacity when compared to a regular treatment program.[98] Tai Chi was not found to be more effective than other exercise intervention programs.[98] Inspiratory and expiratory muscle training (IMT, EMT) is an effective method for improving activities of daily living (ADL). A combination of IMT and walking exercises at home may help limit breathlessness in cases of severe COPD.[99] Additionally, the use of low amplitude high velocity joint mobilization together with exercise improves lung function and exercise capacity.[100] The goal of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) is to improve thoracic mobility in an effort to reduce the work on the lungs during respiration, to in turn increase exercise capacity as indicated by the results of a systemic medical review.[100]
</p><p>Being either underweight or overweight can affect the symptoms, degree of disability, and prognosis of COPD. People with COPD who are underweight can improve their breathing muscle strength by increasing their calorie intake.[5] When combined with regular exercise or a pulmonary rehabilitation program, this can lead to improvements in COPD symptoms. Supplemental nutrition may be useful in those who are malnourished.[101]
</p><h3>Bronchodilators[edit]</h3><p>Inhaled bronchodilators are the primary medications used,[2] and result in a small overall benefit.[102] The two major types are β2 agonists and anticholinergics; both exist in long-acting and short-acting forms.[103] They reduce shortness of breath, wheeze, and exercise limitation, resulting in an improved quality of life.[104] It is unclear if they change the progression of the underlying disease.[2]
</p><p>In those with mild disease, short-acting agents are recommended on an as needed basis.[2] In those with more severe disease, long-acting agents are recommended.[2] Long-acting agents partly work by reducing hyperinflation.[60] If long-acting bronchodilators are insufficient, then inhaled corticosteroids are typically added.[2] Which type of long-acting agent, tiotropium (a long-acting anticholinergic) or a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) is better is unclear, and trying each and continuing with the one that works best may be advisable.[105] Both types of agent appear to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations by 15–25%.[2] While both may be used at the same time, any added benefit is of questionable significance.[105]
</p><p>Several short-acting β2 agonists are available, including salbutamol (albuterol) and terbutaline.[106] They provide some relief of symptoms for four to six hours.[106] LABAs such as salmeterol, formoterol, and indacaterol are often used as maintenance therapy. Some feel the evidence of benefits is limited,[107] while others view the evidence of benefit as established.[108][109][110] Long-term use appears safe in COPD[111] with adverse effects include shakiness and heart palpitations.[2] When used with inhaled steroids they increase the risk of pneumonia.[2] While steroids and LABAs may work better together,[107] it is unclear if this slight benefit outweighs the increased risks.[112] There is some evidence that combined treatment of LABAs with long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), an anticholinergic, may result in less exacerbations, less pneumonia, an improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1%), and potential improvements in quality of life when compared to treatment with LABA and an inhaled corticosteriod (ICS).[113] All three together, LABA, LAMA, and ICS, have some evidence of benefits.[114] Indacaterol requires an inhaled dose once a day, and is as effective as the other long-acting β2 agonist drugs that require twice-daily dosing for people with stable COPD.[110]
</p><p>Two main anticholinergics are used in COPD, ipratropium and tiotropium. Ipratropium is a short-acting agent, while tiotropium is long-acting. Tiotropium is associated with a decrease in exacerbations and improved quality of life,[115] and tiotropium provides those benefits better than ipratropium.[116] It does not appear to affect mortality or the overall hospitalization rate.[115] Anticholinergics can cause dry mouth and urinary tract symptoms.[2] They are also associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke.[117][118] Aclidinium, another long-acting agent, reduces hospitalizations associated with COPD and improves quality of life.[119][120][121] The LAMA umeclidinium bromide is another anticholinergic alternative.[122] When compared to tiotropium, the LAMAs aclidinium, glycopyrronium, and umeclidinium appear to have a similar level of efficacy; with all four being more effective than placebo.[123] Further research is needed comparing aclidinium to tiotropium.[121]
</p><h3>Corticosteroids[edit]</h3><p>Corticosteroids are usually used in inhaled form, but may also be used as tablets to treat and prevent acute exacerbations. While inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) have not shown benefit for people with mild COPD, they decrease acute exacerbations in those with either moderate or severe disease.[124] By themselves, they have no effect on overall one-year mortality.[87][125] Whether they affect the progression of the disease is unknown.[2] When used in combination with a LABA, they may decrease mortality compared to either ICSs or LABA alone.[126][127] Inhaled steroids are associated with increased rates of pneumonia.[128] Long-term treatment with steroid tablets is associated with significant side effects.[106]
</p><h3>Other medication[edit]</h3><p>Long-term antibiotics, specifically those from the macrolide class such as erythromycin, reduce the frequency of exacerbations in those who have two or more a year.[129][130][needs update] This practice may be cost effective in some areas of the world.[131] Concerns include that of antibiotic resistance and hearing problems with azithromycin.[130] Methylxanthines such as theophylline generally cause more harm than benefit and thus are usually not recommended,[132] but may be used as a second-line agent in those not controlled by other measures.[5] Mucolytics may help to reduce exacerbations in some people with chronic bronchitis.[133] Cough medicines are not recommended.[106]
</p><p>For people with COPD, the use of cardioselective (heart-specific) beta-blocker therapy does not appear to impair respiratory function.[134] Cardioselective beta-blocker therapy should not be contraindicated for people with COPD.[134][135]
</p><h3>Oxygen[edit]</h3><p>Supplemental oxygen is recommended in those with low oxygen levels at rest (a partial pressure of oxygen less than 50–55 mmHg or oxygen saturations of less than 88%).[106][136] In this group of people, it decreases the risk of heart failure and death if used 15 hours per day[106][136] and may improve people's ability to exercise.[137] In those with normal or mildly low oxygen levels, oxygen supplementation may improve shortness of breath when given during exercise, but may not improve breathlessness during normal daily activities or affect the quality of life.[138] A risk of fires and little benefit exist when those on oxygen continue to smoke.[139] In this situation, some recommend against its use.[140] During acute exacerbations, many require oxygen therapy; the use of high concentrations of oxygen without taking into account a person's oxygen saturations may lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide and worsened outcomes.[141][142] In those at high risk of high carbon dioxide levels, oxygen saturations of 88–92% are recommended, while for those without this risk, recommended levels are 94–98%.[142]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>For those with very severe disease, surgery is sometimes helpful and may include lung transplantation or lung volume-reduction surgery,[2] which involves removing the parts of the lung most damaged by emphysema, allowing the remaining, relatively good lung to expand and work better.[106] It seems to be particularly effective if emphysema predominantly involves the upper lobe, but the procedure increases the risks of early death and adverse events.[143] Lung transplantation is sometimes performed for very severe COPD, particularly in younger individuals.[106]
</p><h3>Exacerbations[edit]</h3><p>Acute exacerbations are typically treated by increasing the use of short-acting bronchodilators.[2] This commonly includes a combination of a short-acting inhaled beta agonist and anticholinergic.[48] These medications can be given either via a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer or via a nebulizer, with both appearing to be equally effective.[48][144] Nebulization may be easier for those who are more unwell.[48] Oxygen supplementation can be useful. Excessive oxygen; however, can result in increased CO2 levels and a decreased level of consciousness.[145]
</p><p>Corticosteroids by mouth improve the chance of recovery and decrease the overall duration of symptoms.[2][48] They work equally well as intravenous steroids but appear to have fewer side effects.[146] Five days of steroids work as well as ten or fourteen.[147] In those with a severe exacerbation, antibiotics improve outcomes.[148] A number of different antibiotics may be used including amoxicillin, doxycycline and azithromycin; whether one is better than the others is unclear.[70] The FDA recommends against the use of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects.[149] There is no clear evidence for those with less severe cases.[150][needs update]
</p><p>For people with type 2 respiratory failure (acutely raised CO2 levels) non-invasive positive pressure ventilation decreases the probability of death or the need of intensive care admission.[2] Additionally, theophylline may have a role in those who do not respond to other measures.[2] Fewer than 20% of exacerbations require hospital admission.[48] In those without acidosis from respiratory failure, home care (""hospital at home"") may be able to help avoid some admissions.[48]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><div>See also: COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</div><p>Infliximab, an immune-suppressing antibody, has been tested in COPD; there was a possibility of harm with no evidence of benefit.[176]
</p><p>Roflumilast, cilomilast, and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors act as a bronchodilator and as an anti-inflammatory. They show promise in decreasing the rate of exacerbations, but do not appear to change a persons quality of life.[2][177] Roflumilast and cilomilast may be associated with side effects such as gastrointestinal issues and weight loss. Sleep disturbances and mood disturbances related to roflumilast have also been reported.[177] PDE4 is recommended to be used as an add-on therapy in case of failure of the standard COPD treatment during excerpations.[177]
</p><p>Several new long-acting agents are under development.[2] Treatment with stem cells is under study.[178] While there is tentative data that it is safe, and the animal data is promising, there is little human data as of 2017.[179][180][181][182] The human data has shown poor results.[179][183]
</p><p>A procedure known as targeted lung denervation, which involves decreasing the parasympathetic nervous system supply of the lungs, is being studied but does not have sufficient data to determine its use.[184] The effectiveness of alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation treatment for people who have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is unclear.[185]
</p><p>Research continues into the use of telehealthcare to treat people with COPD when they experience episodes of shortness of breath; treating people remotely may reduce the number of emergency-room visits and improve the person's quality of life.[186]

53,encephalopathy,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment varies according to the type and severity of the encephalopathy. Anticonvulsants may be prescribed to reduce or halt any seizures. Changes to diet and nutritional supplements may help some people. In severe cases, dialysis or organ replacement surgery may be needed.
</p><p>Sympathomimetic drugs can increase motivation, cognition, motor performance and alertness in persons with encephalopathy caused by brain injury, chronic infections, strokes, brain tumors.[9]
</p><p>When the  encephalopathy is caused by untreated celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, the gluten-free diet stops the progression of brain damage and improves the headaches.[7]

54,endocarditis,"<h2>How Is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Treated?</h2><p>Treatment of HCM depends on whether there is narrowing in the path that blood takes to leave the heart (called the outflow tract); how the heart is functioning; and if arrhythmias are present. Treatment is aimed at preventing symptoms and complications and includes risk identification and regular follow-up, lifestyle changes, medications, and procedures as needed.</p><h2>What Lifestyle Changes Are Recommended to Treat Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy?</h2><ul>
 Diet . Drinking at least six to eight, 8-ounce glasses of water a day is important, unless fluids are restricted. In hot weather, you should increase your fluid intake. Fluid and salt restrictions may be necessary for some patients if heart failure symptoms are present. Ask your doctor about specific fluid and dietary guidelines, including information about alcoholic beverages and caffeinated products.

Exercise. Your doctor will tell you if you may exercise or not. Most people with cardiomyopathy are able to do non-competitive aerobic exercise. However, your doctor may ask you not to exercise, based on your symptoms and the severity of your disease. Heavy weight lifting is not recommended.

Regular follow-up visits. Patients with HCM should have an annual follow-up visit with their cardiologist to monitor their condition. Follow-up appointments may be more frequent when HCM is first diagnosed.
</ul><h2>What Medications Are Used to Treat Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy?</h2><p>Drugs are often used to treat symptoms and prevent further complications of HCM. Medications can help relax the heart and reduce the degree of obstruction so the heart can pump more efficiently. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blocker blockers are two classes of medications that may be prescribed. If you have an arrhythmia, your doctor may prescribe medications to control your heart rate or decrease the occurrence of arrhythmias.</p><p>You may be told to avoid certain medications, such as nitrates, because they lower blood pressure, or digoxin, because it increases the force of the heart's contraction.</p><p>Non-obstructive HCM symptoms may be treated with medications. If heart failure occurs, treatment is aimed at controlling it through heart failure medications and diet changes.</p><p>Your doctor will discuss which medications are best for you.</p><h2>What Surgical Procedures Are Used to Treat Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy?</h2><p>Surgical procedures used to treat HCM include:</p><p>
Septal myectomy. During this surgical procedure, the surgeon removes a small amount of the thickened septal wall of the heart to widen the outflow tract (the path the blood takes) from the left ventricle to the aorta.</p><p>
Ethanol ablation. First, a cardiologist (heart doctor) performs a cardiac catheterization to locate the small coronary artery that supplies blood flow to the septum. A balloon catheter is inserted into the artery and inflated. A contrast agent is injected to locate the swollen septal wall that narrows the passageway from the left ventricle to the aorta. When the bulge is located, a tiny amount of pure alcohol is injected through the catheter. The alcohol kills the cells on contact, causing a small ""controlled"" heart attack. The septum then shrinks back to a more normal size over the following months, widening the passage for blood flow.</p><p>
Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD). ICDs are suggested for people at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. The ICD constantly monitors the heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers energy to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again.</p><h2>How Can I Prevent Endocarditis?</h2><p>People with obstructive HCM may be at increased risk for infective endocarditis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Ask your doctor if you need to take endocarditis precautions, which include:</p><ul>
Telling all your doctors and dentist you have HCM. They should prescribe antibiotics to prevent an infection before performing any procedures on you that may cause bleeding (dental, respiratory, and gastrointestinal procedures).
Calling your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection.
Taking good care of your teeth and gums.

55,epilepsy,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>While many cases are not preventable, efforts to reduce head injuries, provide good care around the time of birth, and reduce environmental parasites such as the pork tapeworm may be effective.[29] Efforts in one part of Central America to decrease rates of pork tapeworm resulted in a 50% decrease in new cases of epilepsy.[18]
</p><h2>Management</h2><div> Wristbands or bracelets denoting their condition are occasionally worn by epileptics should they need medical assistance</div><p>Epilepsy is usually treated with daily medication once a second seizure has occurred,[24][64] while medication may be started after the first seizure in those at high risk for subsequent seizures.[64] Supporting people's self management of their condition may be useful.[90] In drug-resistant cases different management options may be looked at including a special diet, the implantation of a neurostimulator, or neurosurgery.
</p><h3>First aid</h3><p>Rolling a person with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the recovery position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs.[91] Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten.[26][91] Efforts should be taken to prevent further self-injury.[26] Spinal precautions are generally not needed.[91]
</p><p>If a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or if there are more than two seizures in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus.[64][92] This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected;[64] a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this.[91] At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth.[93] Diazepam may also be used rectally.[93] In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred.[64] If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended.[64] Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.[64]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><div> Anticonvulsants</div><p>The mainstay treatment of epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications, possibly for the person's entire life.[24] The choice of anticonvulsant is based on seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, other medications used, other health problems, and the person's age and lifestyle.[93] A single medication is recommended initially;[94] if this is not effective, switching to a single other medication is recommended.[64] Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work.[64] In about half, the first agent is effective; a second single agent helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%.[95] About 30% of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment.[7]
</p><p>There are a number of medications available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures.[96][97][needs update] Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects.[98] In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects.[64] Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line.[64] In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures.[64] If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.[64]
</p><p>The least expensive anticonvulsant is phenobarbital at around US$5 a year.[18] The World Health Organization gives it a first-line recommendation in the developing world and it is commonly used there.[99][100] Access however may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug.[18]
</p><p>Adverse effects from medications are reported in 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected.[101] Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild.[101] Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait.[101] Certain medications have side effects that are not related to dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow.[101] Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects.[101] Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy.[64] Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects,[102] especially when used during the first trimester.[103] Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications.[103] Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.[102]
</p><p>Slowly stopping medications may be reasonable in some people who do not have a seizure for two to four years; however, around a third of people have a recurrence, most often during the first six months.[64][104] Stopping is possible in about 70% of children and 60% of adults.[29] Measuring medication levels is not generally needed in those whose seizures are well controlled.[77]
</p><h3>Surgery</h3><p>Epilepsy surgery may be an option for people with focal seizures that remain a problem despite other treatments.[105][106] These other treatments include at least a trial of two or three medications.[107] The goal of surgery is total control of seizures[108] and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases.[107] Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex.[107] Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition.[107] Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.[107][105]
</p><p>Neurostimulation may be another option in those who are not candidates for surgery.[64] Three types have been used in those who do not respond to medications: vagus nerve stimulation, anterior thalamic stimulation, and closed-loop responsive stimulation.[5][109][110]
</p><h3>Diet</h3><p>There is tentative evidence that a ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) decreases the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some; however, further research is necessary.[6] It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option.[6] About 10% stay on the diet for a few years due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability.[6] Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease.[6] Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective.[6] It is unclear why this diet works.[111] In people with coeliac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity and occipital calcifications, a gluten-free diet may decrease the frequency of seizures.[51]
</p><h3>Other</h3><p>Avoidance therapy consists of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, those who are sensitive to light may have success with using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses.[112] Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in those who do not respond to medications.[113] Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications.[64]
</p><p>Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures,[114] with some data to support this claim.[115] Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure.[116][117] It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.[118]
</p><p>As an add-on therapy in those who are not well controlled with other medications, cannabidiol appears to be useful in some children.[119] In 2018 the FDA approved this product for Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.[120]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>Alternative medicine, including acupuncture,[121] psychological interventions,[122] routine vitamins,[123] and yoga,[124] have no reliable evidence to support their use in epilepsy. Melatonin, as of 2016[update], is insufficiently supported by evidence.[125] The trials were of poor methodological quality and it was not possible to draw any definitive conclusions.[125]
</p><h2>Research</h2><p>Seizure prediction refers to attempts to forecast epileptic seizures based on the EEG before they occur.[155] As of 2011[update], no effective mechanism to predict seizures has been developed.[155] Kindling, where repeated exposures to events that could cause seizures eventually causes seizures more easily, has been used to create animal models of epilepsy.[156]
</p><p>Gene therapy is being studied in some types of epilepsy.[157] Medications that alter immune function, such as intravenous immunoglobulins, are poorly supported by evidence.[158] Noninvasive stereotactic radiosurgery is, as of 2012[update], being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy.[159]

56,exanthema,"Self-Care Guidelines

    For mild symptoms, no treatment is required, as the rash and illness often last only a few days and then go away.
    Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) may be helpful in lowering the fever and reducing aches and pains.
    Drink plenty of liquids and get lots of bed rest.

When to Seek Medical Care?

See your doctor if you have any of the following:

    A temperature over 101 degrees that lasts more than a day
    Severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, unconsciousness, or seizures
    Diarrhea and/or vomiting and severe abdominal pain
    Severe cough or sputum with pus or blood
    Spots, swelling, and redness on the palms or soles, blisters, swollen and painful joints
    Red eyes, mouth, or tongue
    Rash that is bright red and does not fade (blanch) with finger pressure

Treatments Your Physician May Prescribe

Blood tests or procedures to grow out viruses or bacteria (cultures) may be done to look for more serious causes of your rash.
If a serious bacterial or other infection is suspected, antibiotics may be given."
57,failure heart,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>A person's risk of developing heart failure is inversely related to their level of physical activity. Those who achieved at least 500 MET-minutes/week (the recommended minimum by U.S. guidelines) had lower heart failure risk than individuals who did not report exercising during their free time; the reduction in heart failure risk was even greater in those who engaged in higher levels of physical activity than the recommended minimum.[50]
Heart failure can also be prevented by lowering high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and controlling diabetes. Also, remaining at the right weight and reducing obesity can help. Lowering salt, alcohol, quitting smoking, and lowering sugar intake may help.[51]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of heart failure</div><p>Treatment focuses on improving the symptoms and preventing the progression of the disease.  Reversible causes of the heart failure also need to be addressed (e.g. infection, alcohol ingestion, anemia, thyrotoxicosis, arrhythmia, hypertension). Treatments include lifestyle and pharmacological modalities, and occasionally various forms of device therapy and rarely cardiac transplantation.
</p><h3>Acute decompensation[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Acute decompensated heart failure</div><p>In acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the immediate goal is to re-establish adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to end organs. This entails ensuring that airway, breathing, and circulation are adequate.  Immediate treatments usually involve some combination of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, diuretics such as furosemide, and possibly noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Supplemental oxygen is indicated in those with oxygen saturation levels below 90% but is not recommended in those with normal oxygen levels on room air.[52]
</p><h3>Chronic management[edit]</h3><p>The goals of treatment for people with chronic heart failure are the prolongation of life, the prevention of acute decompensation and the reduction of symptoms, allowing for greater activity.
</p><p>Heart failure can result from a variety of conditions. In considering therapeutic options, it is important to first exclude reversible causes, including thyroid disease, anemia, chronic tachycardia, alcohol abuse, hypertension and dysfunction of one or more heart valves. Treatment of the underlying cause is usually the first approach to treating heart failure. However, in the majority of cases, either no primary cause is found or treatment of the primary cause does not restore normal heart function. In these cases, behavioral, medical and device treatment strategies exist which can provide a significant improvement in outcomes, including the relief of symptoms, exercise tolerance, and a decrease in the likelihood of hospitalization or death. Breathlessness rehabilitation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure has been proposed with exercise training as a core component. Rehabilitation should also include other interventions to address shortness of breath including psychological and education needs of people and needs of carers.[53]
</p><h4>Lifestyle[edit]</h4><p>Behavioral modification is a primary consideration in chronic heart failure management program, with dietary guidelines regarding fluid and salt intake.[54] Fluid restriction is important to reduce fluid retention in the body and to correct the hyponatremic status of the body.[39] The evidence of benefit of reducing salt however is poor as of 2018.[55]
</p><p>Exercise should be encouraged and tailored to suit individual capabilities. The inclusion of regular physical conditioning as part of a cardiac rehabilitation program can significantly improve quality of life and reduce the risk of hospital admission for worsening symptoms; however, there is no evidence for a reduction in mortality rates as a result of exercise.  Furthermore, it is not clear whether this evidence can be extended to people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or to those whose exercise regimen takes place entirely at home.[18]
</p><p>Home visits and regular monitoring at heart failure clinics reduce the need for hospitalization and improve life expectancy.[56]
</p><h4>Medication[edit]</h4><p>First-line therapy for people with heart failure due to reduced systolic function should include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) if the person develops a long term cough as a side effect of the ACE-I.[57] Use of medicines from this class is associated with improved survival and quality of life in people with heart failure.[58]
</p><p>Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta blockers) also form part of the first line of treatment, adding to the improvement in symptoms and mortality provided by ACE-I/ARB.[58][59] The mortality benefits of beta blockers in people with systolic dysfunction who also have atrial fibrillation (AF) is more limited than in those who do not have AF.[60] If the ejection fraction is not diminished (HFpEF), the benefits of beta blockers are more modest; a decrease in mortality has been observed but reduction in hospital admission for uncontrolled symptoms has not been observed.[61]
</p><p>In people who are intolerant of ACE-I and ARBs or who have significant kidney dysfunction, the use of combined hydralazine and a long-acting nitrate, such as isosorbide dinitrate, is an effective alternate strategy. This regimen has been shown to reduce mortality in people with moderate heart failure.[62] It is especially beneficial in African-Americans (AA).[62] In AAs who are symptomatic, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (H+I) can be added to ACE-I or ARBs.
</p><p>In people with markedly reduced ejection fraction, the use of an aldosterone antagonist, in addition to beta blockers and ACE-I, can improve symptoms and reduce mortality.[63][64]
</p><p>Second-line medications for CHF do not confer a mortality benefit. Digoxin is one such medication. Its narrow therapeutic window, a high degree of toxicity, and the failure of multiple trials to show a mortality benefit have reduced its role in clinical practice. It is now used in only a small number of people with refractory symptoms, who are in atrial fibrillation and/or who have chronic low blood pressure.
</p><p>Diuretics have been a mainstay of treatment for treatment of fluid accumulation, and include diuretics classes such as loop diuretics, thiazide-like diuretic, and potassium-sparing diuretic. Although widely used, evidence on their efficacy and safety is limited, with the exception of mineralocorticoid antagonists such as spironolactone.[63][65] Mineralocorticoid antagonists in those under 75 years old appear to decrease the risk of death.[66] A recent Cochrane review found that in small studies, the use of diuretics appeared to have improved mortality in individuals with heart failure.[67] However, the extent to which these results can be extrapolated to a general population is unclear due to the small number of participants in the cited studies.[65]
</p><p>Anemia is an independent factor in mortality in people with chronic heart failure. The treatment of anemia significantly improves quality of life for those with heart failure, often with a reduction in severity of the NYHA classification, and also improves mortality rates.[68][69] The latest European guidelines (2012) recommend screening for iron-deficient anemia and treating with parenteral iron if anemia is found.[70]
</p><p>The decision to anticoagulate people with HF, typically with left ventricular ejection fractions <35% is debated, but generally, people with coexisting atrial fibrillation, a prior embolic event, or conditions which increase the risk of an embolic event such as amyloidosis, left ventricular noncompaction, familial dilated cardiomyopathy, or a thromboembolic event in a first-degree relative.[71]
</p><p>Vasopressin receptor antagonist can also be used to treat heart failure. Conivaptan is the first drug approved by US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in those with heart failure.[39] In rare cases hypertonic 3% saline together with diuretics may be used to correct hyponatremia.[39]
</p><p>Sacubitril/valsartan is a combination medication for the treatment of heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. It has been in use as an alternative to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.[72]
</p><h4>Implanted devices[edit]</h4><p>In people with severe cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction below 35%), or in those with recurrent VT or malignant arrhythmias, treatment with an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD)  is indicated to reduce the risk of severe life-threatening arrhythmias. The AICD does not improve symptoms or reduce the incidence of malignant arrhythmias but does reduce mortality from those arrhythmias, often in conjunction with antiarrhythmic medications. In people with left ventricular ejection (LVEF) below 35%, the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or sudden cardiac death is high enough to warrant AICD placement. Its use is therefore recommended in AHA/ACC guidelines.[20]
</p><p>Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is a treatment for people with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic heart failure (NYHA class II–IV)  which enhances both the strength of ventricular contraction and the heart's pumping capacity. The CCM mechanism is based on stimulation of the cardiac muscle by non-excitatory electrical signals (NES), which are delivered by a pacemaker-like device. CCM is particularly suitable for the treatment of heart failure with normal QRS complex duration (120 ms or less) and has been demonstrated to improve the symptoms, quality of life and exercise tolerance.[21][73][74][75][76] CCM is approved for use in Europe, but not currently in North America.[77][78]
</p><p>About one third of people with LVEF below 35% have markedly altered conduction to the ventricles, resulting in dyssynchronous depolarization of the right and left ventricles. This is especially problematic in people with left bundle branch block (blockage of one of the two primary conducting fiber bundles that originate at the base of the heart and carries depolarizing impulses to the left ventricle). Using a special pacing algorithm, biventricular cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can initiate a normal sequence of ventricular depolarization. In people with LVEF below 35% and prolonged QRS duration on ECG (LBBB or QRS of 150 ms or more) there is an improvement in symptoms and mortality when CRT is added to standard medical therapy.[79] However, in the two-thirds of people without prolonged QRS duration, CRT may actually be harmful.[20][21][80]
</p><h4>Surgical therapies[edit]</h4><p>People with the most severe heart failure may be candidates for ventricular assist devices (VAD). VADs have commonly been used as a bridge to heart transplantation, but have been used more recently as a destination treatment for advanced heart failure.[81]
</p><p>In select cases, heart transplantation can be considered. While this may resolve the problems associated with heart failure, the person must generally remain on an immunosuppressive regimen to prevent rejection, which has its own significant downsides.[82]  A major limitation of this treatment option is the scarcity of hearts available for transplantation.
</p><h3>Palliative care[edit]</h3><p>People with heart failure often have significant symptoms, such as shortness of breath and chest pain. Palliative care should be initiated early in the HF trajectory, and should not be an option of last resort.[83] Palliative care can not only provide symptom management, but also assist with advanced care planning, goals of care in the case of a significant decline, and making sure the person has a medical power of attorney and discussed his or her wishes with this individual.[84] A 2016 and 2017 review found that palliative care is associated with improved outcomes, such as quality of life, symptom burden, and satisfaction with care.[85][83]
</p><p>Without transplantation, heart failure may not be reversible and cardiac function typically deteriorates with time.  The growing number of people with Stage IV heart failure (intractable symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain at rest despite optimal medical therapy) should be considered for palliative care or hospice, according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.[84]
</p><h2>Research directions[edit]</h2><p>There is low-quality evidence that stem cell therapy may help.[110] Although this evidence positively indicated benefit, the evidence was of lower quality than other evidence that does not indicate benefit.[111] A 2016 Cochrane review found tentative evidence of longer life expectancy and improved left ventricular ejection fraction in persons treated with bone marrow-derived stem cells.[110]
</p>"
58,failure heart congestive,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>A person's risk of developing heart failure is inversely related to their level of physical activity. Those who achieved at least 500 MET-minutes/week (the recommended minimum by U.S. guidelines) had lower heart failure risk than individuals who did not report exercising during their free time; the reduction in heart failure risk was even greater in those who engaged in higher levels of physical activity than the recommended minimum.[50]
Heart failure can also be prevented by lowering high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and controlling diabetes. Also, remaining at the right weight and reducing obesity can help. Lowering salt, alcohol, quitting smoking, and lowering sugar intake may help.[51]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of heart failure</div><p>Treatment focuses on improving the symptoms and preventing the progression of the disease.  Reversible causes of the heart failure also need to be addressed (e.g. infection, alcohol ingestion, anemia, thyrotoxicosis, arrhythmia, hypertension). Treatments include lifestyle and pharmacological modalities, and occasionally various forms of device therapy and rarely cardiac transplantation.
</p><h3>Acute decompensation[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Acute decompensated heart failure</div><p>In acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the immediate goal is to re-establish adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to end organs. This entails ensuring that airway, breathing, and circulation are adequate.  Immediate treatments usually involve some combination of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, diuretics such as furosemide, and possibly noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Supplemental oxygen is indicated in those with oxygen saturation levels below 90% but is not recommended in those with normal oxygen levels on room air.[52]
</p><h3>Chronic management[edit]</h3><p>The goals of treatment for people with chronic heart failure are the prolongation of life, the prevention of acute decompensation and the reduction of symptoms, allowing for greater activity.
</p><p>Heart failure can result from a variety of conditions. In considering therapeutic options, it is important to first exclude reversible causes, including thyroid disease, anemia, chronic tachycardia, alcohol abuse, hypertension and dysfunction of one or more heart valves. Treatment of the underlying cause is usually the first approach to treating heart failure. However, in the majority of cases, either no primary cause is found or treatment of the primary cause does not restore normal heart function. In these cases, behavioral, medical and device treatment strategies exist which can provide a significant improvement in outcomes, including the relief of symptoms, exercise tolerance, and a decrease in the likelihood of hospitalization or death. Breathlessness rehabilitation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure has been proposed with exercise training as a core component. Rehabilitation should also include other interventions to address shortness of breath including psychological and education needs of people and needs of carers.[53]
</p><h4>Lifestyle[edit]</h4><p>Behavioral modification is a primary consideration in chronic heart failure management program, with dietary guidelines regarding fluid and salt intake.[54] Fluid restriction is important to reduce fluid retention in the body and to correct the hyponatremic status of the body.[39] The evidence of benefit of reducing salt however is poor as of 2018.[55]
</p><p>Exercise should be encouraged and tailored to suit individual capabilities. The inclusion of regular physical conditioning as part of a cardiac rehabilitation program can significantly improve quality of life and reduce the risk of hospital admission for worsening symptoms; however, there is no evidence for a reduction in mortality rates as a result of exercise.  Furthermore, it is not clear whether this evidence can be extended to people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or to those whose exercise regimen takes place entirely at home.[18]
</p><p>Home visits and regular monitoring at heart failure clinics reduce the need for hospitalization and improve life expectancy.[56]
</p><h4>Medication[edit]</h4><p>First-line therapy for people with heart failure due to reduced systolic function should include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) if the person develops a long term cough as a side effect of the ACE-I.[57] Use of medicines from this class is associated with improved survival and quality of life in people with heart failure.[58]
</p><p>Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta blockers) also form part of the first line of treatment, adding to the improvement in symptoms and mortality provided by ACE-I/ARB.[58][59] The mortality benefits of beta blockers in people with systolic dysfunction who also have atrial fibrillation (AF) is more limited than in those who do not have AF.[60] If the ejection fraction is not diminished (HFpEF), the benefits of beta blockers are more modest; a decrease in mortality has been observed but reduction in hospital admission for uncontrolled symptoms has not been observed.[61]
</p><p>In people who are intolerant of ACE-I and ARBs or who have significant kidney dysfunction, the use of combined hydralazine and a long-acting nitrate, such as isosorbide dinitrate, is an effective alternate strategy. This regimen has been shown to reduce mortality in people with moderate heart failure.[62] It is especially beneficial in African-Americans (AA).[62] In AAs who are symptomatic, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (H+I) can be added to ACE-I or ARBs.
</p><p>In people with markedly reduced ejection fraction, the use of an aldosterone antagonist, in addition to beta blockers and ACE-I, can improve symptoms and reduce mortality.[63][64]
</p><p>Second-line medications for CHF do not confer a mortality benefit. Digoxin is one such medication. Its narrow therapeutic window, a high degree of toxicity, and the failure of multiple trials to show a mortality benefit have reduced its role in clinical practice. It is now used in only a small number of people with refractory symptoms, who are in atrial fibrillation and/or who have chronic low blood pressure.
</p><p>Diuretics have been a mainstay of treatment for treatment of fluid accumulation, and include diuretics classes such as loop diuretics, thiazide-like diuretic, and potassium-sparing diuretic. Although widely used, evidence on their efficacy and safety is limited, with the exception of mineralocorticoid antagonists such as spironolactone.[63][65] Mineralocorticoid antagonists in those under 75 years old appear to decrease the risk of death.[66] A recent Cochrane review found that in small studies, the use of diuretics appeared to have improved mortality in individuals with heart failure.[67] However, the extent to which these results can be extrapolated to a general population is unclear due to the small number of participants in the cited studies.[65]
</p><p>Anemia is an independent factor in mortality in people with chronic heart failure. The treatment of anemia significantly improves quality of life for those with heart failure, often with a reduction in severity of the NYHA classification, and also improves mortality rates.[68][69] The latest European guidelines (2012) recommend screening for iron-deficient anemia and treating with parenteral iron if anemia is found.[70]
</p><p>The decision to anticoagulate people with HF, typically with left ventricular ejection fractions <35% is debated, but generally, people with coexisting atrial fibrillation, a prior embolic event, or conditions which increase the risk of an embolic event such as amyloidosis, left ventricular noncompaction, familial dilated cardiomyopathy, or a thromboembolic event in a first-degree relative.[71]
</p><p>Vasopressin receptor antagonist can also be used to treat heart failure. Conivaptan is the first drug approved by US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in those with heart failure.[39] In rare cases hypertonic 3% saline together with diuretics may be used to correct hyponatremia.[39]
</p><p>Sacubitril/valsartan is a combination medication for the treatment of heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. It has been in use as an alternative to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.[72]
</p><h4>Implanted devices[edit]</h4><p>In people with severe cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction below 35%), or in those with recurrent VT or malignant arrhythmias, treatment with an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD)  is indicated to reduce the risk of severe life-threatening arrhythmias. The AICD does not improve symptoms or reduce the incidence of malignant arrhythmias but does reduce mortality from those arrhythmias, often in conjunction with antiarrhythmic medications. In people with left ventricular ejection (LVEF) below 35%, the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or sudden cardiac death is high enough to warrant AICD placement. Its use is therefore recommended in AHA/ACC guidelines.[20]

59,failure kidney,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>In non-diabetics and people with type 1 diabetes, a low protein diet is found to have a preventative effect on progression of chronic kidney disease. However, this effect does not apply to people with type 2 diabetes.[33] A whole food, plant-based diet may help some people with kidney disease.[34] A high protein diet from either animal or plant sources appears to have negative effects on kidney function at least in the short term.[35]
</p><h3>Slowing progression[edit]</h3><p>People who received earlier referrals to a nephrology specialist, meaning a longer time before they had to start dialysis, had a shorter initial hospitalization and reduced risk of death after the start of dialysis.[36] The authors highlighted the resulting importance of early referral in slowing progression of chronic kidney disease.[36] Other methods of reducing disease progression include minimizing exposure to nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs and intravenous contrast.[37]
</p>"
60,fibroid tumor,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Most fibroids do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms. After menopause, fibroids shrink, and it is unusual for them to cause problems.
</p><p>Symptomatic uterine fibroids can be treated by:
</p><ul>medication to control symptoms (i.e., symptomatic management)
medication aimed at shrinking tumors
ultrasound fibroid destruction
myomectomy or radiofrequency ablation
hysterectomy
uterine artery embolization</ul><p>In those who have symptoms, uterine artery embolization and surgical options have similar outcomes with respect to satisfaction.[36]
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>A number of medications may be used to control symptoms. NSAIDs can be used to reduce painful menstrual periods. Oral contraceptive pills may be prescribed to reduce uterine bleeding and cramps.[9] Anemia may be treated with iron supplementation.
</p><p>Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices are effective in limiting menstrual blood flow and improving other symptoms. Side effects are typically few as the levonorgestrel (a progestin) is released in low concentration locally.[37] While most levongestrel-IUD studies concentrated on treatment of women without fibroids a few reported good results specifically for women with fibroids including a substantial regression of fibroids.[38][39]
</p><p>Cabergoline in a moderate and well-tolerated dose has been shown in two studies to shrink fibroids effectively. The mechanism of action responsible for how cabergoline shrinks fibroids is unclear.[38]
</p><p>Ulipristal acetate is a synthetic selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) that has tentative evidence to support its use for presurgical treatment of fibroids with low side-effects.[40] Long-term UPA-treated fibroids have shown volume reduction of about 70%.[41] In some cases UPA alone is used to relieve symptoms without surgery.[7]
</p><p>Danazol is an effective treatment to shrink fibroids and control symptoms. Its use is limited by unpleasant side effects. Mechanism of action is thought to be antiestrogenic effects. Recent experience indicates that safety and side effect profile can be improved by more cautious dosing.[38]
</p><p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause temporary regression of fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels. Because of the limitations and side effects of this medication, it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink the size of the fibroids and uterus before surgery. It is typically used for a maximum of 6 months or less because after longer use they could cause osteoporosis and other typically postmenopausal complications. The main side effects are transient postmenopausal symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however, significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency. Several add-back regimes are possible, tibolone, raloxifene, progestogens alone, estrogen alone, and combined estrogens and progestogens.[38]
</p><p>Progesterone antagonists such as mifepristone have been tested, there is evidence that it relieves some symptoms and improves quality of life but because of adverse histological changes that have been observed in several trials it can not be currently recommended outside of research setting.[42][43] Fibroid growth has recurred after antiprogestin treatment was stopped.[33]
</p><p>Aromatase inhibitors have been used experimentally to reduce fibroids. The effect is believed to be due partially by lowering systemic estrogen levels and partially by inhibiting locally overexpressed aromatase in fibroids.[38] However, fibroid growth has recurred after treatment was stopped.[33] Experience from experimental aromatase inhibitor treatment of endometriosis indicates that aromatase inhibitors might be particularly useful in combination with a progestogenic ovulation inhibitor.
</p><h3>Uterine artery[edit]</h3><p>Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a noninvasive procedure that blocks of blood flow to fibroids and thus can treat them.[44] Long-term outcomes with respect to how happy people are with the procedure are similar to that of surgery.[45] There is tentative evidence that traditional surgery may result in better fertility.[45] One review found that UAE doubles the future risk of miscarriage.[46] UAE also appears to require more repeat procedures than if surgery was done initially.[45] A person will usually recover from the procedure within a few days.
</p><p>Uterine artery ligation, sometimes also laparoscopic occlusion of uterine arteries are minimally invasive methods to limit blood supply of the uterus by a small surgery that can be performed transvaginally or laparoscopically. The principal mechanism of action may be similar like in UAE but is easier to perform and fewer side effects are expected.[47][non-primary source needed][48][non-primary source needed]
</p><p>The 2016 NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence – the non governmental public body that publishes guidelines in the use of health technologies and good clinical practice in the United Kingdom) guidelines state UAE/UFE can be offered to women with symptomatic fibroids ( fibroids being usually >30mm in size). Women should be informed that UAE and myomectomy (the surgical removal of fibroids) may potentially allow them to retain their fertility.[49]
</p><h3>Myomectomy[edit]</h3><div> Submucosal fibroid in hysteroscopy</div><div> Treatment of an intramural fibroid by laparoscopic surgery</div><div> After treatment of an intramural fibroid by laparoscopic surgery</div><p>Myomectomy is a surgery to remove one or more fibroids. It is usually recommended when more conservative treatment options fail for women who want fertility preserving surgery or who want to retain the uterus.[50]
</p><p>There are three types of myomectomy:
</p><ul>In a hysteroscopic myomectomy (also called transcervical resection), the fibroid can be removed by either the use of a resectoscope, an endoscopic instrument inserted through the vagina and cervix that can use high-frequency electrical energy to cut tissue, or a similar device.
A laparoscopic myomectomy is done through a small incision near the navel.  The physician uses a laparoscope and surgical instruments to remove the fibroids.  Studies have suggested that laparoscopic myomectomy leads to lower morbidity rates and faster recovery than does laparotomic myomectomy.[51]
A laparotomic myomectomy (also known as an open or abdominal myomectomy) is the most invasive surgical procedure to remove fibroids.  The physician makes an incision in the abdominal wall and removes the fibroids from the uterus.</ul><p>Laparoscopic myomectomy has less pain and shorter time in hospital than open surgery.[52]
</p><h3>Hysterectomy[edit]</h3><p>Hysterectomy was the classical method of treating fibroids. Although it is now recommended only as last option, fibroids are still the leading cause of hysterectomies in the US.
</p><h3>Endometrial ablation[edit]</h3><p>Endometrial ablation can be used if the fibroids are only within the uterus and not intramural and relatively small. High failure and recurrence rates are expected in the presence of larger or intramural fibroids.
</p><h3>Other procedures[edit]</h3><p>Radiofrequency ablation is a minimally invasive treatments for fibroids.[53] In this technique the fibroid is shrunk by inserting a needle-like device into the fibroid through the abdomen and heating it with radio-frequency (RF) electrical energy to cause necrosis of cells. The treatment is a potential option for women who have fibroids, have completed child-bearing and want to avoid a hysterectomy.
</p><p>Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound, is a non-invasive intervention (requiring no incision) that uses high intensity focused ultrasound waves to destroy tissue in combination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which guides and monitors the treatment. During the procedure, delivery of focused ultrasound energy is guided and controlled using MR thermal imaging.[54] Patients who have symptomatic fibroids, who desire a non-invasive treatment option and who do not have contraindications for MRI are candidates for MRgFUS. About 60% of patients qualify. It is an outpatient procedure and takes one to three hours depending on the size of the fibroids. It is safe and about 75% effective.[55] Symptomatic improvement is sustained for two plus years.[56] Need for additional treatment varies from 16-20% and is largely dependent on the amount of fibroid that can be safely ablated; the higher the ablated volume, the lower the re-treatment rate.[57] There are currently no randomized trial between MRgFUS and UAE. A multi-center trial is underway to investigate the efficacy of MRgFUS vs. UAE.
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Selective progesterone receptor modulators, such as progenta, have been under investigation. Another selective progesterone receptor modulator asoprisnil is being tested with promising results as a possible use as a treatment for fibroids, intended to provide the advantages of progesterone antagonists without their adverse effects.[38] Low dietary intake of vitamin D is associated with the development of uterine fibroids.[12]
</p>"
61,gastritis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Antacids are a common treatment for mild to medium gastritis.[22] When antacids do not provide enough relief, medications such as H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors that help reduce the amount of acid are often prescribed.[22][23]
</p><p>Cytoprotective agents are designed to help protect the tissues that line the stomach and small intestine.[24] They include the medications sucralfate and misoprostol. If NSAIDs are being taken regularly, one of these medications to protect the stomach may also be taken. Another cytoprotective agent is bismuth subsalicylate[citation needed].
</p><p>Several regimens are used to treat H. pylori infection. Most use a combination of two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor. Sometimes bismuth is added to the regimen.

62,gastroenteritis,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div> Percentage of rotavirus tests with positive results, by surveillance week, United States, July 2000 – June 2009.</div><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[43]
Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]
</p><h3>Vaccination</h3><p>Due to both its effectiveness and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that the rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally.[25][44] Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development.[44] In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants[44] and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen a decline in the rates and severity of disease.[45][46] This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections.[47] Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent.[48][49][50] The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age.[25] The oral cholera vaccine has been found to be 50–60% effective over 2 years.[51]
</p><h2>Management</h2><p>Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limiting disease that does not require medication.[22] The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT).[24] For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful,[52] and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.[53]
</p><h3>Rehydration</h3><p>The primary treatment of gastroenteritis in both children and adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required if there is a decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe.[54][55] Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars.[56] Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea.[22] Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them.[22] A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.[13] In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.[57]
</p><h3>Dietary</h3><p>It is recommended that breast-fed infants continue to be nursed in the usual fashion,  and that formula-fed infants continue their formula immediately after rehydration with ORT.[58] Lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas usually are not necessary.[58] Children should continue their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea with the exception that foods high in simple sugars should be avoided.[58] The BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and tea) is no longer recommended, as it contains insufficient nutrients and has no benefit over normal feeding.[58]
</p><p>Some probiotics have been shown to be beneficial in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools.[59][60] They may also be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea.[61] Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial.[62] Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.[63]
</p><h3>Antiemetics</h3><p>Antiemetic medications may be helpful for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting.[52][64][65][66] Metoclopramide might also be helpful.[66] However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children.[67] The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants.[68] Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, does not appear to have a significant clinical benefit.[1]
</p><h3>Antibiotics</h3><p>Antibiotics are not usually used for gastroenteritis, although they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe[69] or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected.[70] If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates of resistance to the latter.[19] Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin.[71] Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella[72] Salmonella typhi,[73] and Giardia species.[35] In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole.[35][74][needs update] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.[1]
</p><h3>Antimotility agents</h3><p>Antimotility medication has a theoretical risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown this to be unlikely,[42] these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever.[75] Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea.[76] Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, can be used in mild to moderate cases,[42] but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.[1]
</p><h2>Research</h2><p>There are a number of vaccines against gastroenteritis in development. For example, vaccines against Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), two of the leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis worldwide.[84][85]
</p>"
63,gastroesophageal reflux disease,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatments for GERD may include food choices, lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly surgery. Initial treatment is frequently with a proton-pump inhibitor such as omeprazole.[26] In some cases, a person with GERD symptoms can manage them by taking over-the-counter drugs.[32] This is often safer and less expensive than taking prescription drugs.[32] Some guidelines recommend trying to treat symptoms with an H2 antagonist before using a proton-pump inhibitor because of cost and safety concerns.[32]
</p><h3>Lifestyle changes[edit]</h3><p>Certain foods may promote GERD, but most dietary interventions have little effect.[33] Some evidence suggests that reduced sugar intake and increased fiber intake can help.[34] Avoidance of specific foods and eating before lying down are recommended for those having GERD symptoms.[27] Foods that may precipitate GERD include coffee, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods, acidic foods, and spicy foods.[27]
</p><p>Weight loss may be effective in reducing the severity and frequency of symptoms.[35] Elevating the head of the entire bed with blocks, or using a wedge pillow that elevates the individual's shoulders and head, may inhibit GERD when lying down.[36] Although moderate exercise may improve symptoms in people with GERD, vigorous exercise may worsen them.[33]
</p><p>Abstinence from smoking or alcohol does not appear to significantly relieve symptoms.[35]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Drugs for acid-related disorders</div><p>The primary medications used for GERD are proton-pump inhibitors, H2 receptor blockers and antacids with or without alginic acid.[8] The use of acid suppression therapy is a common response to GERD symptoms and many people get more of this kind of treatment than their case merits.[37] The overuse of acid suppression is a problem because of the side effects and costs.[37]
</p><h4>Proton-pump inhibitors[edit]</h4><p>Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole, are the most effective, followed by H2 receptor blockers, such as ranitidine.[27] If a once daily PPI is only partially effective they may be used twice a day.[27] They should be taken one half to one hour before a meal.[26] There is no significant difference between PPIs.[26] When these medications are used long term, the lowest effective dose should be taken.[27] They may also be taken only when symptoms occur in those with frequent problems.[26] H2 receptor blockers lead to roughly a 40% improvement.[38]
</p><h4>Antacids[edit]</h4><p>The evidence for antacids is weaker with a benefit of about 10% (NNT=13) while a combination of an antacid and alginic acid (such as Gaviscon) may improve symptoms 60% (NNT=4).[38] Metoclopramide (a prokinetic) is not recommended either alone or in combination with other treatments due to concerns around adverse effects.[8][27] The benefit of the prokinetic mosapride is modest.[8]
</p><h4>Other agents[edit]</h4><p>Sucralfate has a similar effectiveness to H2 receptor blockers; however, sucralfate needs to be taken multiple times a day, thus limiting its use.[8] Baclofen, an agonist of the GABAB receptor, while effective, has similar issues of needing frequent dosing in addition to greater adverse effects compared to other medications.[8]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>The standard surgical treatment for severe GERD is the Nissen fundoplication. In this procedure, the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent acid reflux and to repair a hiatal hernia.[39] It is recommended only for those who do not improve with PPIs.[26] Quality of life is improved in the short term compared to medical therapy, but there is uncertainty in the benefits over surgery versus long-term medical management with proton pump inhibitors.[40] When comparing different fundoplication techniques, partial posterior fundoplication surgery is more effective than partial anterior fundoplication surgery,[41] and partial fundoplication has better outcomes than total fundoplication.[42]
</p><p>Esophagogastric dissociation is an alternative procedure that is sometimes used to treat neurologically impaired children with GERD.[43][44] Preliminary studies have shown it may have a lower failure rate[45] and a lower incidence of recurrent reflux.[44]
</p><p>In 2012 the FDA approved a device called the LINX, which consists of a series of metal beads with magnetic cores that are placed surgically around the lower esophageal sphincter, for those with severe symptoms that do not respond to other treatments. Improvement of GERD symptoms is similar to those of the Nissen fundoplication, although there is no data regarding long-term effects. Compared to Nissen fundoplication procedures, the procedure has shown a reduction in complications such as gas bloat syndrome that commonly occur.[46] Adverse responses include difficulty swallowing, chest pain, vomiting, and nausea. Contraindications that would advise against use of the device are patients who are or may be allergic to titanium, stainless steel, nickel, or ferrous iron materials. A warning advises that the device should not be used by patients who could be exposed to, or undergo, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of serious injury to the patient and damage to the device.[47]
</p><p>In those with symptoms that do not improve with PPIs surgery known as transoral incisionless fundoplication may help.[48] Benefits may last for up to six years.[49]
</p><h3>Special populations[edit]</h3><h4>Pregnancy[edit]</h4><p>In pregnancy, dietary modifications and lifestyle changes may be attempted, but often have little effect. Calcium-based antacids are recommended if these changes are not effective. Aluminum- and magnesium-based antacids are also safe, as is ranitidine[50] and PPIs.[26]
</p><h4>Babies[edit]</h4><p>Babies may see relief with smaller, more frequent feedings, more frequent burping during feedings, holding baby in upright position 30 minutes after feedings, keep baby's head elevated while laying on the back, remove milk and soy from mothers diet or feed milk protein free formula.[51]  They may also be treated with medicines such as ranitidine or proton pump inhibitors.[52] Proton pump inhibitors however have not been found to be effective in this population and there is a lack of evidence for safety.[53]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>A number of endoscopic devices have been tested to treat chronic heartburn.
</p><ul>Endocinch, puts stitches in the lower esophogeal sphincter (LES) to create small pleats to help strengthen the muscle. However, long-term results were disappointing, and the device is no longer sold by Bard.[55]
Stretta procedure, uses electrodes to apply radio-frequency energy to the LES. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis in response to the systematic review (no meta-analysis) conducted by SAGES did not support the claims that Stretta was an effective treatment for GERD.[56] A 2012 systematic review found that it improves GERD symptoms.[57]
NDO Surgical Plicator creates a plication, or fold, of tissue near the gastroesophageal junction, and fixates the plication with a suture-based implant. The company ceased operations in mid-2008, and the device is no longer on the market.
Transoral incisionless fundoplication, which uses a device called Esophyx, may be effective.[58]</ul>"
64,glaucoma,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The modern goals of glaucoma management are to avoid glaucomatous damage and nerve damage, and preserve visual field and total quality of life for patients, with minimal side-effects.[56][57] This requires appropriate diagnostic techniques and follow-up examinations, and judicious selection of treatments for the individual patient. Although intraocular pressure (IOP) is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment. A review of people with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension concluded that medical IOP lowering treatment slowed down the progression of visual field loss.[7]
</p><p>Vascular flow and neurodegenerative theories of glaucomatous optic neuropathy have prompted studies on various neuroprotective therapeutic strategies, including nutritional compounds, some of which may be regarded by clinicians as safe for use now, while others are on trial.
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><div> Latanoprost</div><div>Main article: Glaucoma medication</div><p>Intraocular pressure can be lowered with medication, usually eye drops. Several classes of medications are used to treat glaucoma, with several medications in each class.
</p><p>Each of these medicines may have local and systemic side effects. Adherence to medication protocol can be confusing and expensive; if side effects occur, the patient must be willing either to tolerate them or to communicate with the treating physician to improve the drug regimen. Initially, glaucoma drops may reasonably be started in either one or in both eyes.[58] Wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops may result in fewer adverse effects, like the growth of eyelashes and hyperpigmentation in the eyelid.[59]
</p><p>Poor compliance with medications and follow-up visits is a major reason for vision loss in glaucoma patients. A 2003 study of patients in an HMO found half failed to fill their prescriptions the first time, and one-fourth failed to refill their prescriptions a second time.[60] Patient education and communication must be ongoing to sustain successful treatment plans for this lifelong disease with no early symptoms.
</p><p>The possible neuroprotective effects of various topical and systemic medications are also being investigated.[14][61][62][63]
</p><ul>Prostaglandin analogs, such as latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost, increase uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor. Bimatoprost also increases trabecular outflow.
Topical beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as timolol, levobunolol,  and betaxolol, decrease aqueous humor production by the epithelium of the ciliary body.
Alpha2-adrenergic agonists, such as brimonidine and apraclonidine, work by a dual mechanism, decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow.
Less-selective alpha agonists, such as epinephrine, decrease aqueous humor production through vasoconstriction of ciliary body blood vessels, useful only in open-angle glaucoma. Epinephrine's mydriatic effect, however, renders it unsuitable for closed-angle glaucoma due to further narrowing of the uveoscleral outflow (i.e. further closure of trabecular meshwork, which is responsible for absorption of aqueous humor).
Miotic agents (parasympathomimetics), such as pilocarpine, work by contraction of the ciliary muscle, opening the trabecular meshwork and allowing increased outflow of the aqueous humour. Echothiophate, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used in chronic glaucoma.
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide, brinzolamide, and acetazolamide, lower secretion of aqueous humor by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body.</ul><h3>Laser[edit]</h3><p>Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) may be used to treat open-angle glaucoma, but this is a temporary solution, not a cure. A 50-μm argon laser spot is aimed at the trabecular meshwork to stimulate the opening of the mesh to allow more outflow of aqueous fluid. Usually, half of the angle is treated at a time. Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an argon laser trabeculoplasty procedure.
</p><p>A newer type of laser trabeculoplasty uses a ""cold"" (nonthermal) laser to stimulate drainage in the trabecular meshwork. This newer procedure, selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), uses a 532-nm, frequency-doubled, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, which selectively targets melanin pigment in the trabecular meshwork cells. Studies show SLT is as effective as ALT at lowering eye pressure. In addition, SLT may be repeated three to four times, whereas ALT can usually be repeated only once.
</p><p>Nd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) may be used in patients susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.
</p><p>Diode laser cycloablation lowers IOP by reducing aqueous secretion by destroying secretory ciliary epithelium.[42]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><div> Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma makes a new opening in the trabecular meshwork, which helps fluid to leave the eye and lowers intraocular pressure.</div><div>Main article: Glaucoma surgery</div><p>Both laser and conventional surgeries are performed to treat glaucoma.  Surgery is the primary therapy for those with congenital glaucoma.[64]  Generally, these operations are a temporary solution, as there is not yet a cure for glaucoma.
</p><h4>Canaloplasty[edit]</h4><p>Canaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure using microcatheter technology. To perform a canaloplasty, an incision is made into the eye to gain access to the Schlemm's canal in a similar fashion to a viscocanalostomy. A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened.
</p><p>By opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye may be relieved, although the reason is unclear, since the canal (of Schlemm) does not have any significant fluid resistance in glaucoma or healthy eyes. Long-term results are not available.[65][66]
</p><h4>Trabeculectomy[edit]</h4><p>The most common conventional surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy. Here, a partial thickness flap is made in the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble on the surface of the eye.
</p><p>Scarring can occur around or over the flap opening, causing it to become less effective or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), are applied with soaked sponges on the wound bed to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the meshwork opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.[67][68][69][70]
</p><p>Collagen matrix prevents scarring by randomizing and modulating fibroblast proliferation in addition to mechanically preventing wound contraction and adhesion.
</p><h4>Glaucoma drainage implants[edit]</h4><div>Main article: Glaucoma valve</div><p>Professor Anthony Molteno developed the first glaucoma drainage implant, in Cape Town in 1966.[71] Since then, several types of implants have followed on from the original, the Baerveldt tube shunt, or the valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant or the ExPress Mini Shunt and the later generation pressure ridge Molteno implants. These are indicated for glaucoma patients not responding to maximal medical therapy, with previous failed guarded filtering surgery (trabeculectomy). The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye, and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow a flow of aqueous fluid out of the eye into a chamber called a bleb.
</p><ul>The first-generation Molteno and other nonvalved implants sometimes require the ligation of the tube until the bleb formed is mildly fibrosed and water-tight.[72] This is done to reduce postoperative hypotony—sudden drops in postoperative intraocular pressure.
Valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve, attempt to control postoperative hypotony by using a mechanical valve.
Ab interno implants, such as the Xen Gel Stent, are transscleral implants by an ab interno procedure to channel aqueous humor into the non-dissected Tenon's space, creating a subconjunctival drainage area similar to a bleb.[73][74] The implants are transscleral and different from more other ab interno implants that do not create a transscleral drainage, such as iStent, CyPass, or Hydrus.[75]</ul><p>The ongoing scarring over the conjunctival dissipation segment of the shunt may become too thick for the aqueous humor to filter through. This may require preventive measures using antifibrotic medications, such as 5-fluorouracil or mitomycin-C (during the procedure), or other nonantifibrotic medication methods, such as collagen matrix implant,[76][77] or biodegradable spacer, or later on create a necessity for revision surgery with the sole or combinative use of donor patch grafts or collagen matrix implant.[78] And for glaucomatous painful blind eye and some cases of glaucoma, cyclocryotherapy for ciliary body ablation could be considered to be performed.[79]
</p><h4>Laser-assisted nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy[edit]</h4><p>The most common surgical approach currently used for the treatment of glaucoma is trabeculectomy, in which the sclera is punctured to alleviate intraocular pressure.
</p><p>Nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) surgery is a similar, but modified, procedure, in which instead of puncturing the scleral bed and trabecular meshwork under a scleral flap, a second deep scleral flap is created, excised, with further procedures of deroofing the Schlemm's canal, upon which, percolation of liquid from the inner eye is achieved and thus alleviating intraocular pressure, without penetrating the eye. NPDS is demonstrated to have significantly fewer side effects than trabeculectomy.[80]  However, NPDS is performed manually and requires higher level of skills that may be assisted with instruments.[citation needed]      In order to prevent wound adhesion after deep scleral excision and to maintain good filtering results, NPDS as with other non-penetrating procedures is sometimes performed with a variety of biocompatible spacer or devices, such as the Aquaflow collagen wick,[81] ologen Collagen Matrix,[69][82][83] or Xenoplast glaucoma implant.[84]
</p><p>Laser-assisted NPDS is performed with the use of a CO2 laser system. The laser-based system is self-terminating once the required scleral thickness and adequate drainage of the intraocular fluid have been achieved. This self-regulation effect is achieved as the CO2 laser essentially stops ablating as soon as it comes in contact with the intraocular percolated liquid, which occurs as soon as the laser reaches the optimal residual intact layer thickness.
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><div>Play media Scientists track eye movements in glaucoma patients to check vision impairment while driving</div><h3>Rho kinase inhibitors[edit]</h3><p>Rho kinase inhibitors, such as ripasudil, work by inhibition of the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in the morphological changes in the trabecular meshwork and increased aqueous outflow. More compounds in this class are being investigated in phase 2 and phase 3 trials.[99]
</p><h3>Neuroprotective agents[edit]</h3><p>A 2013 Cochrane Systematic Review compared the effect of brimonidine and timolol in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma in adult participants.[100] The results showed that participants assigned to brimonidine showed less visual field progression that those assigned to timolol, though the results were not significant, given the heavy loss-to-followup and limited evidence.[100] The mean intraocular pressures for both groups were similar. Participants in the brimonidine group had a higher occurrence of side effects caused by medication than participants in the timolol group.[100]
</p><h3>Cannabis[edit]</h3><p>Studies in the 1970s reported that the use of cannabis may lower intraocular pressure.[101][102][103] In an effort to determine whether marijuana, or drugs derived from it, might be effective as a glaucoma treatment, the US National Eye Institute supported research studies from 1978 to 1984. These studies demonstrated some derivatives of marijuana lowered intraocular pressure when administered orally, intravenously, or by smoking, but not when topically applied to the eye.
</p><p>In 2003, the American Academy of Ophthalmology released a position statement stating that cannabis was not more effective than prescription medications.  Furthermore, no scientific evidence has been found that demonstrates increased benefits and/or diminished risks of cannabis use to treat glaucoma compared with the wide variety of pharmaceutical agents now available.[103][104]
</p><p>In 2010 the American Glaucoma Society published a position paper discrediting the use of cannabis as a legitimate treatment for elevated intraocular pressure, for reasons including short duration of action and side effects that limit many activities of daily living.[105]

65,gout,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>Both lifestyle changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of purine-rich foods of animal origin such as meat and seafood, alcohol, and fructose (especially high fructose corn syrup).[6] Eating dairy products, vitamin C, coffee, and cherries may help prevent gout attacks, as does losing weight.[6][47] Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of apnea can lessen the occurrence of attacks.[48]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>A number of medications are useful for preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, probenecid, febuxostat, and colchicine.[10][49] Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout,[3] unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist.[15] It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective.[3] They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack.[3] They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine for the first three to six months.[4][10]
</p><p>Urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300–360 µmol/l (5.0–6.0 mg/dl) and continue indefinitely.[3][4][50] If these medications are in chronic use at the time of an attack, it is recommended that they be continued.[9] Levels that cannot be brought below 6.0 mg/dl while attacks continue indicates refractory gout.[51]
</p><p>While historically it is not recommended to start allopurinol during an acute attack of gout, this practice appears acceptable.[52] Allopurinol blocks uric acid production, and is the most commonly used agent.[3] Long term therapy is safe and well tolerated, and can be used in people with renal impairment or urate stones, although hypersensitivity occurs in a small number of individuals.[3]
</p><p>Febuxostat is only recommended in those who cannot tolerate allopurinol.[53] There are concerns about more deaths with febuxostat compared to allopurinol.[54] Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent.[3][49] Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800 mg).[55] It is, however, not recommended if a person has a history of kidney stones.[55] Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications.[56] It is a third line agent.[49] Pegloticase is given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks,[56] and reduces uric acid levels.[57] Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it.[58][49] In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.[59][60]
</p><p>Lesinurad reduces blood uric acid levels by preventing uric acid absorption in the kidneys.[61] It was approved in the United States for use together with allopurinol, among those who were unable to reach their uric acid level targets.[62] Side effects include kidney problems and kidney stones.[61][63]
</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The initial aim of treatment is to settle the symptoms of an acute attack.[64] Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels.[64] Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day to decrease pain.[65] Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and steroids.[3] While steroids and NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may be safer.[66] Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease.[4] Treatment of associated health problems is also important.[4] Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied.[65] It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.[67]
</p><h3>NSAIDs</h3><p>NSAIDs are the usual first-line treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly more or less effective than any other.[3] Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks.[3][4] They are not recommended for those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure.[68] While indometacin has historically been the most commonly used NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness.[31] For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given.[69] There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.[70][71]
</p><h3>Colchicine</h3><p>Colchicine is an alternative for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs.[3] At high doses, side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage.[72] At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated.[31][73] Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs, such as atorvastatin and erythromycin, among others.[72]
</p><h3>Steroids</h3><p>Glucocorticoids have been found to be as effective as NSAIDs[74][75] and may be used if contraindications exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsen this condition.[3]
</p><h3>Others</h3><p>Interleukin-1 inhibitors, such as canakinumab, showed moderate effectiveness for pain relief and reduction of joint swelling, but have increased risk of adverse events, such as back pain, headache, and increased blood pressure.[76] They, however, may work less well than usual doses of NSAIDS.[76] The high cost of this class of drugs may also discourage their use for treating gout.[76]
</p><h2>Research</h2><p>A number of new medications are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept.[93] Canakinumab may result in better outcomes than a low dose of a steroid, but costs five thousand times more.[94] A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available but its use is limited, as it triggers an immune response. Less antigenic versions are in development.[13]
</p>"
66,hemiparesis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment for hemiparesis is the same treatment given to those recovering from strokes or brain injuries.[1] Health care professionals such as physical therapists and occupational therapists play a large role in assisting these patients in their recovery. Treatment is focused on improving sensation and motor abilities, allowing the patient to better manage their activities of daily living. Some strategies used for treatment include promoting the use of the hemiparetic limb during functional tasks, maintaining range of motion, and using neuromuscular electrical stimulation to decrease spasticity and increase awareness of the limb.
</p><p>At the more advanced level, using constraint-induced movement therapy will encourage overall function and use of the affected limb.[29] Mirror Therapy (MT) has also been used early in stroke rehabilitation and involves using the unaffected limb to stimulate motor function of the hemiparetic limb. Results from a study on patients with severe hemiparesis concluded that MT was successful in improving motor and sensory function of the distal hemiparetic upper limb.[30]  Active participation is critical to the motor learning and recovery process, therefore it’s important to keep these individuals motivated so they can make continual improvements.[31]
Also speech pathologists work to increase function for people with hemiparesis.
</p><p>Treatment should be based on assessment by the relevant health professionals, including physiotherapists, doctors and occupational therapists. Muscles with severe motor impairment including weakness need these therapists to assist them with specific exercise, and are likely to require help to do this.[32]
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>Drugs can be used to treat issues related to the Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome. Drugs like Librium or Valium could be used as a relaxant. Drugs are also given to individuals who have recurrent seizures, which may be a separate but related problem after brain injury.[33]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Surgery may be used if the individual develops a secondary issue of contracture, from a severe imbalance of muscle activity. In such cases the surgeon may cut the ligaments and relieve joint contractures. Individuals who are unable to swallow may have a tube inserted into the stomach. This allows food to be given directly into the stomach. The food is in liquid form and instilled at low rates. Some individuals with hemiplegia will benefit from some type of prosthetic device. There are many types of braces and splints available to stabilize a joint, assist with walking and keep the upper body erect.
</p><h3>Rehabilitation[edit]</h3><p>Rehabilitation is the main treatment of individuals with hemiplegia. In all cases, the major aim of rehabilitation is to regain maximum function and quality of life. Both physical and occupational therapy can significantly improve the quality of life.
</p><h3>Physical therapy[edit]</h3><p>Physical therapy  (PT) can help improve muscle strength & coordination, mobility (such as standing and walking), and other physical function using different sensorimotor techniques.[34]  Physiotherapists can also help reduce shoulder pain by maintaining shoulder range of motion, as well as using Functional electrical stimulation.[35]  Supportive devices, such as braces or slings, can be used to help prevent or treat shoulder subluxation[36] in the hopes to minimize disability and pain.  Although many individuals suffering from stroke experience both shoulder pain and shoulder subluxation, the two are mutually exclusive.[37] A treatment method that can be implemented with the goal of helping to regain motor function in the affected limb is constraint-induced movement therapy. This consists of constraining the unaffected limb, forcing the affected limb to accomplish tasks of daily living.[38]
</p><h3>Occupational therapy[edit]</h3><p>Occupational therapists may specifically help with hemiplegia with tasks such as improving hand function, strengthening hand, shoulder and torso, and participating in activities of daily living (ADLs), such as eating and dressing.  Therapists may also recommend a hand splint for active use or for stretching at night. Some therapists actually make the splint; others may measure your child’s hand and order a splint. OTs educate patients and family on compensatory techniques to continue participating in daily living, fostering independence for the individual - which may include, environmental modification, use of adaptive equipment, sensory integration, etc.

67,hemorrhoids,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>A number of preventative measures are recommended, including avoiding straining while attempting to defecate, avoiding constipation and diarrhea either by eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluid or by taking fiber supplements, and getting sufficient exercise.[5][17] Spending less time attempting to defecate, avoiding reading while on the toilet,[1] and losing weight for overweight persons and avoiding heavy lifting are also recommended.[18]
</p><h2>Management</h2><h3>Conservative</h3><p>Conservative treatment typically consists of foods rich in dietary fiber, intake of oral fluids to maintain hydration, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sitz baths, and rest.[1] Increased fiber intake has been shown to improve outcomes[19] and may be achieved by dietary alterations or the consumption of fiber supplements.[1][19] Evidence for benefits from sitz baths during any point in treatment, however, is lacking.[20] If they are used, they should be limited to 15 minutes at a time.[2]:182 Decreasing time spent on the toilet and not straining is also recommended.[21]
</p><p>While many topical agents and suppositories are available for the treatment of hemorrhoids, little evidence supports their use.[1] Steroid-containing agents should not be used for more than 14 days, as they may cause thinning of the skin.[1] Most agents include a combination of active ingredients.[2] These may include a barrier cream such as petroleum jelly or zinc oxide, an analgesic agent such as lidocaine, and a vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine.[2] Some contain Balsam of Peru to which certain people may be allergic.[22][23]
</p><p>Flavonoids are of questionable benefit, with potential side effects.[2][24] Symptoms usually resolve following pregnancy; thus active treatment is often delayed until after delivery.[25] Evidence does not support the use of traditional Chinese herbal treatment.[26]
</p><h3>Procedures</h3><div> Rubber band ligation.</div><p>A number of office-based procedures may be performed. While generally safe, rare serious side effects such as perianal sepsis may occur.[6]
</p><ul>Rubber band ligation is typically recommended as the first-line treatment in those with grade 1 to 3 disease.[6] It is a procedure in which elastic bands are applied onto an internal hemorrhoid at least 1 cm above the pectinate line to cut off its blood supply. Within 5–7 days, the withered hemorrhoid falls off. If the band is placed too close to the pectinate line, intense pain results immediately afterwards.[1] Cure rate has been found to be about 87%[1] with a complication rate of up to 3%.[6]
Sclerotherapy involves the injection of a sclerosing agent, such as phenol, into the hemorrhoid. This causes the vein walls to collapse and the hemorrhoids to shrivel up. The success rate four years after treatment is about 70%.[1]
A number of cauterization methods have been shown to be effective for hemorrhoids, but are usually only used when other methods fail. This procedure can be done using electrocautery, infrared radiation, laser surgery,[1] or cryosurgery.[27] Infrared cauterization may be an option for grade 1 or 2 disease.[6] In those with grade 3 or 4 disease, reoccurrence rates are high.[6]</ul><h3>Surgery</h3><p>A number of surgical techniques may be used if conservative management and simple procedures fail.[6] All surgical treatments are associated with some degree of complications including bleeding, infection, anal strictures and urinary retention, due to the close proximity of the rectum to the nerves that supply the bladder.[1] Also, a small risk of fecal incontinence occurs, particularly of liquid,[2][28] with rates reported between 0% and 28%.[29] Mucosal ectropion is another condition which may occur after hemorrhoidectomy (often together with anal stenosis).[30] This is where the anal mucosa becomes everted from the anus, similar to a very mild form of rectal prolapse.[30]
</p><ul>Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is a surgical excision of the hemorrhoid used primarily only in severe cases.[1] It is associated with significant postoperative pain and usually requires 2–4 weeks for recovery.[1] However, the long-term benefit is greater in those with grade 3 hemorrhoids as compared to rubber band ligation.[31] It is the recommended treatment in those with a thrombosed external hemorrhoid if carried out within 24–72 hours.[6][12] Evidence to support this however is weak.[21] Glyceryl trinitrate ointment after the procedure helps both with pain and healing.[32]
Doppler-guided, transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization is a minimally invasive treatment using an ultrasound doppler to accurately locate the arterial blood inflow. These arteries are then ""tied off"" and the prolapsed tissue is sutured back to its normal position. It has a slightly higher recurrence rate, but fewer complications compared to a hemorrhoidectomy.[1]
Stapled hemorrhoidectomy,  also known as stapled hemorrhoidopexy, involves the removal of much of the abnormally enlarged hemorrhoidal tissue, followed by a repositioning of the remaining hemorrhoidal tissue back to its normal anatomical position. It is generally less painful and is associated with faster healing compared to complete removal of hemorrhoids.[1] However, the chance of symptomatic hemorrhoids returning is greater than for conventional hemorroidectomy,[33] so it is typically only recommended for grade 2 or 3 disease.[6]</ul>"
68,hepatitis,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Vaccines[edit]</h3><div> Recommended immunization schedules in the United States for ages 0 through 18 years as of 2016</div><h4>Hepatitis A[edit]</h4><div>Main article: Hepatitis A vaccine</div><p>The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[73][74]
</p><p>For children 12 months of age or older, the vaccination is given as a shot into the muscle in two doses 6–18 months apart and should be started before the age 24 months.[84]  The dosing is slightly different for adults depending on the type of the vaccine.  If the vaccine is for hepatitis A only, two doses are given 6–18 months apart depending on the manufacturer.[75]  If the vaccine is combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B, up to 4 doses may be required.[75]
</p><h4>Hepatitis B[edit]</h4><div>Main article: Hepatitis B vaccine</div><p>The CDC recommends the routine vaccination of all children under the age of 19 with the hepatitis B vaccine.[85] They also recommend it for those who desire it or are at high risk.[74]
</p><p>Routine vaccination for hepatitis B starts with the first dose administered as  a shot into the muscle before the newborn is discharged from the hospital.  An additional two doses should be administered before the child is 18 months.[84]
</p><p>For babies born to a mother with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, the first dose is unique – in addition to the vaccine, the hepatitis immune globulin should also be administered, both within 12 hours of birth.  These newborns should also be regularly tested for infection for at least the first year of life.[84]
</p><p>There is also a combination formulation that includes both hepatitis A and B vaccines.[86]
</p><h4>Other[edit]</h4><p>There are currently no vaccines available in the United States for hepatitis C  or E.[81][87][88]
</p><h3>Behavioral changes[edit]</h3><h4>Hepatitis A[edit]</h4><p>Because hepatitis A is transmitted primarily through the oral-fecal route, the mainstay of prevention aside from vaccination is good hygiene, access to clean water and proper handling of sewage.[74]
</p><h4>Hepatitis B and C[edit]</h4><p>As hepatitis B and C are transmitted through blood and multiple bodily fluids, prevention is aimed at screening blood prior to transfusion, abstaining from the use of injection drugs, safe needle and sharps practices in healthcare settings, and safe sex practices.[25][81]
</p><h4>Hepatitis D[edit]</h4><p>The hepatitis D virus requires that a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B. In people who have chronic hepatitis B infection and are at risk for superinfection with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B.[88]
</p><h4>Hepatitis E[edit]</h4><p>Hepatitis E is spread primarily through the oral-fecal route but may also be spread by blood and from mother to fetus.  The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention is similar to that for hepatitis A (namely, good hygiene and clean water practices).[87]
</p><h4>Alcoholic hepatitis[edit]</h4><p>As excessive alcohol consumption can lead to hepatitis and cirrhosis, the following are maximal recommendations for alcohol consumption:[89]
</p><ul>Women – ≤ 3 drinks on any given day and ≤ 7 drinks per week
Men – ≤ 4 drinks on any given day and ≤ 14 drinks per week</ul><h3>Successes[edit]</h3><h4>Hepatitis A[edit]</h4><p>In the United States, universal immunization has led to a two-thirds decrease in hospital admissions and medical expenses due to hepatitis A.[90]
</p><h4>Hepatitis B[edit]</h4><p>In the United States new cases of hepatitis B decreased 75% from 1990–2004.[91]  The group that saw the greatest decrease was children and adolescents, likely reflecting the implementation of the 1999 guidelines.[92]
</p><h4>Hepatitis C[edit]</h4><p>Hepatitis C infections each year had been declining since the 1980s, but began to increase again in 2006.[93]  The data are unclear as to whether the decline can be attributed to needle exchange programmes.[94]
</p><h4>Alcoholic hepatitis[edit]</h4><p>Because people with alcoholic hepatitis may have no symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose and the number of people with the disease is probably higher than many estimates.[95] Programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous have been successful in decreasing death due to cirrhosis, but it is difficult to evaluate their success in decreasing the incidence of alcoholic hepatitis.[96]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment of hepatitis varies based on the form (acute versus chronic), severity of disease, and cause. 
</p><h3>Hepatitis A[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Hepatitis A</div><p>Hepatitis A generally does not progress to a chronic state and rarely requires hospitalization.[14][73] Treatment is supportive and includes such measures as providing intravenous (IV) hydration and maintaining adequate nutrition.[14][73]
</p><p>Rarely, people with the hepatitis A virus can rapidly develop liver failure, termed fulminant hepatic failure, especially the elderly and those who had a pre-existing liver disease, especially hepatitis C.[14][73] Mortality risk factors include greater age and chronic hepatitis C.[14] In these cases, more aggressive supportive therapy and liver transplant may be necessary.[14]
</p><h3>Hepatitis B[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Hepatitis B</div><h4>Acute[edit]</h4><p>In healthy patients, 95–99% recover with no long-lasting effects, and antiviral treatment is not warranted.[14] Age and comorbid conditions can result in a more prolonged and severe illness. Certain patients warrant hospitalization, especially those who present with clinical signs of ascites, peripheral edema, and hepatic encephalopathy, and laboratory signs of hypoglycemia, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin, and very high serum bilirubin.[14]
</p><p>In these rare, more severe acute cases, patients have been successfully treated with antiviral therapy similar to that used in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or tenofovir. As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.[14]
</p><h4>Chronic[edit]</h4><p>Chronic hepatitis B management aims to control viral replication, which is correlated with progression of disease.[17] There have been 7 drug treatments approved to date in the United States:[17]
</p><ul>Injectable interferon alpha was the first therapy approved for chronic hepatitis B.[17] It has several side effects, most of which are reversible with removal of therapy, but it has been supplanted by newer treatments for this indication.[17] These include long-acting interferon bound to polyethylene glycol (pegylated interferon) and the oral nucleoside analogues.[17]
Pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) is dosed just once a week as a subcutaneous injection and is both more convenient and effective than standard interferon.[17] Although it does not develop resistance as do many of the oral antivirals, it is poorly tolerated and requires close monitoring.[17] PEG IFN is estimated to cost about $18,000 per year in the United States, compared to $2,500-8,700 for the oral medications; however, its treatment duration is 48 weeks as opposed to the oral antivirals, which require indefinite treatment for most patients (minimum 1 year).[17] PEG IFN is not effective in patients with high levels of viral activity and cannot be used in immunosuppressed patients or those with cirrhosis.[17]
Lamivudine was the first approved oral nucleoside analogue.[17] While effective and potent, lamivudine has been replaced by newer, more potent treatments in the Western world and is no longer recommended as first-line treatment.[17] However, it is still used in areas where newer agents either have not been approved or are too costly.[17] Generally, the course of treatment is a minimum of one year with a minimum of six additional months of ""consolidation therapy.""[17] Based on viral response, longer therapy may be required, and certain patients require indefinite long-term therapy.[17] Due to a less robust response in Asian patients, consolidation therapy is recommended to be extended to at least a year.[17] All patients should be monitored for viral reactivation, which if identified, requires restarting treatment.[17] Lamivudine is generally safe and well-tolerated.[17] Many patients develop resistance, which is correlated with longer treatment duration.[17] If this occurs, an additional antiviral is added.[17] Lamivudine as a single treatment is contraindicated in patients coinfected with HIV, as resistance develops rapidly, but it can be used as part of a multidrug regimen.[17]
Adefovir dipivoxil, a nucleotide analogue, has been used to supplement lamivudine in patients who develop resistance, but is no longer recommended as first-line therapy.[17]
Entecavir is safe, well tolerated, less prone to developing resistance, and the most potent of the existing hepatitis B antivirals; it is thus a first-line treatment choice.[17] It is not recommended for lamivudine-resistant patients or as monotherapy in patients who are HIV positive.[17]
Telbivudine is effective but not recommended as first-line treatment; as compared to entecavir, it is both less potent and more resistance prone.[17]
Tenofovir is a nucleotide analogue and an antiretroviral drug that is also used to treat HIV infection.[17] It is preferred to adefovir both in lamivudine-resistant patients and as initial treatment since it is both more potent and less likely to develop resistance.[17]</ul><p>First-line treatments currently used include PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir, subject to patient and physician preference.[17] Treatment initiation is guided by recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and is based on detectable viral levels, HBeAg positive or negative status, ALT levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy.[17] In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x103 IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level.[17][77] In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment and evaluation for liver transplantation are recommended in all cases if HBV DNA is detectable.[17][77] Currently, multidrug treatment is not recommended in treatment of chronic HBV as it is no more effective in the long term than individual treatment with entecavir or tenofovir.[17]
</p><h3>Hepatitis C[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Hepatitis C</div><p>In contrast to hepatitis A and B, progression to chronic hepatitis C is much more common.[14] The ultimate goal of hepatitis C treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).[97] The best way to reduce the long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR).[97] SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure.[98][99] Currently available treatments include indirect and direct acting antiviral drugs.[98][99] The indirect acting antivirals include pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV.[98][99] Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype.[98][99] These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas.[98][99] In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes:[98][99]
</p><ul>NS3/4A protease inhibitors, including telaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir, and others
NS5A inhibitors, including ledipasvir, daclatasvir, and others
NS5B polymerase inhibitors, including sofosbuvir, dasabuvir, and others</ul><p>These drugs are used in various combinations, sometimes combined with ribavirin, based on the patient's genotype (delineated as genotypes 1-6).[99] Genotype 1 (GT1), which is the most prevalent genotype in the United States and around the world, can now be cured with a direct acting antiviral regimen.[99] First-line therapy for GT1 is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks for most patients, including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.[99] Certain patients with early disease need only 8 weeks of treatment while those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have not responded to prior treatment require 24 weeks.[99] Cost remains a major factor limiting access to these drugs, particularly in low-resource nations; the cost of the 12-week GT1 regimen (SOF/LDV)  has been estimated at US$94,500.[98]
</p><p>The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (AASLD-IDSA) recommend antiviral treatment for all patients with chronic hepatitis C infection except for those with additional chronic medical conditions that limit their life expectancy.[83]
</p><h3>Hepatitis D[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Hepatitis D</div><p>Hepatitis D is difficult to treat, and effective treatments are lacking. Interferon alpha has proven effective at inhibiting viral activity but only on a temporary basis.[100]
</p><h3>Hepatitis E[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Hepatitis E</div><p>Similar to hepatitis A, treatment of hepatitis E is supportive and includes rest and ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration.[101] Hospitalization may be required for particularly severe cases or for pregnant women.[101]
</p><h3>Alcoholic hepatitis[edit]</h3><p>First-line treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is treatment of alcoholism.[30] For those who abstain completely from alcohol, reversal of liver disease and a longer life are possible; patients at every disease stage have been shown to benefit by prevention of additional liver injury.[30][58] In addition to referral to psychotherapy and other treatment programs, treatment should include nutritional and psychosocial evaluation and treatment.[30][58][102] Patients should also be treated appropriately for related signs and symptoms, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and infection.[58]
</p><p>Severe alcoholic hepatitis has a poor prognosis and is notoriously difficult to treat.[30][58][102] Without any treatment, 20-50% of patients may die within a month, but evidence shows treatment may extend life beyond one month (i.e., reduce short-term mortality).[30][102][103] Available treatment options include pentoxifylline (PTX), which is a nonspecific TNF inhibitor, corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone (CS), corticosteroids with N-acetylcysteine (CS with NAC), and corticosteroids with pentoxifylline (CS with PTX).[102] Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC are most effective at reducing short-term mortality.[102] Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis.[30][58] In these cases PTX may be considered on a case by case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is better than no treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo.[102][103] Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients’ risk of dying in the longer term, at 3–12 months and beyond.[102]
</p><p>Weak evidence suggests milk thistle extracts may improve survival in alcoholic liver disease and improve certain liver tests (serum bilirubin and GGT) without causing side effects, but a firm recommendation cannot be made for or against milk thistle without further study.[104] 
</p><h3>Recommendations[edit]</h3><p>Many people with hepatitis will prefer bed rest, though it is not necessary to avoid all physical activity while recovering.[14] A high-calorie diet is recommended.[14] Many people develop nausea and cannot tolerate food later in the day, so the bulk of intake may be concentrated in the earlier part of the day.[14] In the acute phase of the disease, intravenous feeding may be needed if patients cannot tolerate food and have poor oral intake subsequent to nausea and vomiting.[14]
</p><p>People with hepatitis should avoid taking drugs metabolized by the liver.[14] Glucocorticoids are not recommended as a treatment option for acute viral hepatitis and may even cause harm, such as development of chronic hepatitis.[14]
</p><p>Universal precautions should be observed, but isolation is not strictly necessary; isolation may be needed in cases of fecal incontinence in hepatitis A and E and uncontrolled bleeding in hepatitis B and C.[14]
</p><h2>Research directions[edit]</h2><h3>Hepatitis B[edit]</h3><p>A Canadian paper published in 2015 used a mouse model of chronic hepatitis B infection and showed that interfering with certain proteins can facilitate clearance of the virus[149] which may have implications for human disease.
</p><h3>Hepatitis E[edit]</h3><p>In March 2015, a group in China published an article regarding the development of a vaccine for hepatitis E.[150] As of March 2016, the United States government was in the process of recruiting participants for the phase IV trial of the drug Hecolin.[151]
</p>"
69,hepatitis B,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Vaccine[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Hepatitis B vaccine</div><p>Vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B have been routinely recommended for babies since 1991 in the United States.[64] The first dose is generally recommended within a day of birth.[65]
</p><p>Most vaccines are given in three doses over a course of months. A protective response to the vaccine is defined as an anti-HBs antibody concentration of  at least 10 mIU/ml in the recipient's serum. The vaccine is more effective in children and 95 percent of those vaccinated have protective levels of antibody. This drops to around 90% at 40 years of age  and to around 75 percent in those over 60 years. The protection afforded by vaccination is long lasting even after antibody levels fall below 10 mIU/ml. For newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers: hepatitis B vaccine alone, hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone, or the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin, all prevent hepatitis B occurrence.[66] Furthermore, the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin is superior to vaccine alone.[66] This combination prevents HBV transmission around the time of birth in 86% to 99% of cases.[67]
</p><p>Tenofovir given in the second or third trimester can reduce the risk of mother to child transmission by 77% when combined with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and the hepatitis B vaccine, especially for pregnant women with high hepatitis B virus DNA levels.[68] However, there is no sufficient evidence that the administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone during pregnancy, might reduce transmission rates to the newborn infant.[69]  No randomized control trial has been conducted to assess the effects of hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy for preventing infant infection.[70]
</p><p>All those with a risk of exposure to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already.[64] Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses of vaccine are given to those who are not sufficiently immunized.[64]
</p><p>In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among those with a normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections have been documented.[71] Vaccination is particularly recommended for high risk groups including: health workers, people with chronic renal failure, and men who have sex with men.[72][73][74]
</p><p>Both types of the hepatitis B vaccine, the plasma-derived vaccine (PDV) and recombinant vaccine (RV) are of similar effectiveness in preventing the infection in both healthcare workers and chronic renal failure groups.[72][73] With one difference noticed among health worker group, that the RV intramuscular route is significantly more effective compared with RV intradermal route of administration.[72]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>In assisted reproductive technology, sperm washing is not necessary for males with hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated.[75] In females with hepatitis B, the risk of transmission from mother to child with IVF is no different from the risk in spontaneous conception.[75]
</p><p>Those at high risk of infection should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease.[76] Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, men who have sex with men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.[76]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Acute hepatitis B infection does not usually require treatment and most adults clear the infection spontaneously.[77][78] Early antiviral treatment may be required in fewer than 1% of people, whose infection takes a very aggressive course (fulminant hepatitis) or who are immunocompromised. On the other hand, treatment of chronic infection may be necessary to reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronically infected individuals with persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver damage, and HBV DNA levels are candidates for therapy.[79] Treatment lasts from six months to a year, depending on medication and genotype.[80] Treatment duration when medication is taken by mouth, however, is more variable and usually longer than one year.[81]
</p><p>Although none of the available medications can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. As of 2018, there are eight medications licensed for the treatment of hepatitis B infection in the United States. These include antiviral medications lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, telbivudine, and entecavir, and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha-2a and PEGylated interferon alpha-2a. In 2015 the World Health Organization recommended tenofovir or entecavir as first-line agents.[82] Those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment.[82]
</p><p>The use of interferon, which requires injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly.[83] However, some individuals are much more likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood).[84] Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.[85]
</p>"
70,hepatitis C,"<h2>Prevention</h2><div>See also: Hepatitis C vaccine</div><p>As of 2016[update], no approved vaccine protects against contracting hepatitis C.[78] A combination of harm reduction strategies, such as the provision of new needles and syringes and treatment of substance use, decreases the risk of hepatitis C in intravenous drug users by about 75%.[79] The screening of blood donors is important at a national level, as is adhering to universal precautions within healthcare facilities.[20] In countries where there is an insufficient supply of sterile syringes, medications should be given orally rather than via injection (when possible).[25]
</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>HCV induces chronic infection in 80% of infected persons.[1] Approximately 95% of these clear with treatment.[4] In rare cases, infection can clear without treatment.[17] Those with chronic hepatitis C are advised to avoid alcohol and medications toxic to the liver.[15] They should also be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B due to the increased risk if also infected.[15] Use of acetaminophen is generally considered safe at reduced doses.[10] Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended in those with advanced liver disease due to an increased risk of bleeding.[10] Ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma is recommended in those with accompanying cirrhosis.[15] Coffee consumption has been associated with a slower rate of liver scarring in those infected with HCV.[10]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>Treatment with antiviral medication is recommended in all people with proven chronic hepatitis C who are not at high risk of dying from other causes.[80] People with the highest complication risk should be treated first, with the risk of complications based on the degree of liver scarring.[80] The initial recommended treatment depends on the type of hepatitis C virus, if the person has received previous hepatitis C treatment, and whether or not a person has cirrhosis.[81] Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) may reduce the number of the infected people.[82]
</p><h4>No prior treatment</h4><ul>HCV genotype 1a (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (the latter for people who do not have HIV/AIDS, are not African-American, and have less than 6 million HCV viral copies per milliliter of blood) or 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.[83] Sofosbuvir with either daclatasvir or simeprevir may also be used.[81]
HCV genotype 1a (with compensated cirrhosis): 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. An alternative treatment regimen of elbasvir/grazoprevir with weight-based ribavirin for 16 weeks can be used if the HCV is found to have antiviral resistance mutations against NS5A protease inhibitors.[84]
HCV genotype 1b (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (with the aforementioned limitations for the latter as above) or 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Alternative regimens include 12 weeks of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir with either daclatasvir or simeprevir.[85]
HCV genotype 1b (with compensated cirrhosis): 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. A 12-week course of paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir with dasabuvir may also be used.[86]
HCV genotype 2 (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Alternatively, 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir can be used.[87]
HCV genotype 2 (with compensated cirrhosis): 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. An alternative regimen of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir can be used for 16–24 weeks.[88]
HCV genotype 3 (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.[89]
HCV genotype 3 (with compensated cirrhosis): 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, or if certain antiviral mutations are present, 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (when certain antiviral mutations are present), or 24 weeks of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.[90]
HCV genotype 4 (no cirrhosis): 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. A 12-week regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is also acceptable in combination with weight-based ribavirin.[91]
HCV genotype 4 (with compensated cirrhosis): A 12-week regimen of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasavir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is recommended. A 12-week course of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir  with weight-based ribavirin is an acceptable alternative.[92]
HCV genotype 5 or 6 (with or without compensated cirrhosis): If no cirrhosis is present, then 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is recommended. If cirrhosis is present, then a 12-week course of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is warranted.[93]</ul><p>Chronic infection can be cured about 95% of the time with recommended treatment in 2017.[1][4] Getting access to these treatments however can be expensive.[4] The combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir may be used in those who have previously been treated with sofosbuvir or other drugs that inhibit NS5A and were not cured.[94]
</p><p>Prior to 2011, treatments consisted of a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin for a period of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype.[15] This produces cure rates of between 70 and 80% for genotype 2 and 3, respectively, and 45 to 70% for genotypes 1 and 4.[95] Adverse effects with these treatments were common, with half of people getting flu-like symptoms and a third experiencing emotional problems.[15] Treatment during the first six months is more effective than once hepatitis C has become chronic.[28] In those with chronic hepatitis B, treatment for hepatitis C results in reactivation of hepatitis B in about 25%.[96]
</p><h3>Surgery</h3><p>Cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is a common reason for liver transplantation[28] though the virus usually (80–90% of cases) recurs afterwards.[5][97] Infection of the graft leads to 10–30% of people developing cirrhosis within five years.[98] Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin post-transplant decreases the risk of recurrence to 70%.[99] A 2013 review found unclear evidence regarding if antiviral medication was useful if the graft became reinfetcted.[100]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>Several alternative therapies are claimed by their proponents to be helpful for hepatitis C including milk thistle, ginseng, and colloidal silver.[101] However, no alternative therapy has been shown to improve outcomes in hepatitis C, and no evidence exists that alternative therapies have any effect on the virus at all.[101][102][103]
</p><h2>Research</h2><p>As of 2011[update], there are about one hundred medications in development for hepatitis C.[128] These include vaccines to treat hepatitis, immunomodulators, and cyclophilin inhibitors, among others.[142] These potential new treatments have come about due to a better understanding of the hepatitis C virus.[143] There are a number of vaccines under development and some have shown encouraging results.[78]
</p><p>The combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in one trial (reported in 2015) resulted in cure rates of 99%.[144] More studies are needed to investigate the role of the preventative antiviral medication against HCV recurrence after transplantation.[145]
</p><h3>Animal models</h3><p>One barrier to finding treatments for hepatitis C is the lack of a suitable animal model. Despite moderate success, current research highlights the need for pre-clinical testing in mammalian systems such as mouse, particularly for the development of vaccines in poorer communities. Currently, chimpanzees remain the available living system to study, yet their use has ethical concerns and regulatory restrictions. While scientists have made use of human cell culture systems such as hepatocytes, questions have been raised about their accuracy in reflecting the body's response to infection.[146]
</p><p>One aspect of hepatitis research is to reproduce infections in mammalian models. A strategy is to introduce liver tissues from humans into mice, a technique known as xenotransplantation. This is done by generating chimeric mice, and exposing the mice HCV infection. This engineering process is known to create humanized mice, and provide opportunities to study hepatitis C within the 3D architectural design of the liver and evaluating antiviral compounds.[146] Alternatively, generating inbred mice with susceptibility to HCV would simplify the process of studying mouse models.

71,hernia,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><div>Main articles: Hernia repair and Inguinal hernia surgery</div><div> Hernia repair being performed aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan.</div><h3>Truss[edit]</h3><p>The benefits of the use of an external device to maintain reduction of the hernia without repairing the underlying defect (such as hernia trusses, trunks, belts, etc.) are unclear.[1]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Surgery is recommended for some types of hernias to prevent complications like obstruction of the bowel or strangulation of the tissue, although umbilical hernias and hiatus hernias may be watched, or are treated with medication.[17] Most abdominal hernias can be surgically repaired, but surgery has complications. Time needed for recovery after treatment is reduced if hernias are operated on laparoscopically. However, open surgery can be done sometimes without general anesthesia. Uncomplicated hernias are principally repaired by pushing back, or ""reducing"", the herniated tissue, and then mending the weakness in muscle tissue (an operation called herniorrhaphy). If complications have occurred, the surgeon will check the viability of the herniated organ and remove part of it if necessary.
</p><p>Muscle reinforcement techniques often involve synthetic materials (a mesh prosthesis).[18] The mesh is placed either over the defect (anterior repair) or under the defect (posterior repair). At times staples are used to keep the mesh in place. These mesh repair methods are often called ""tension free"" repairs because, unlike some suture methods (e.g., Shouldice), muscle is not pulled together under tension. However, this widely used terminology is misleading, as there are many tension-free suture methods that do not use mesh (e.g., Desarda, Guarnieri, Lipton-Estrin, etc.).
</p><p>Evidence suggests that tension-free methods (with or without mesh) often have lower percentage of recurrences and the fastest recovery period compared to tension suture methods. However, among other possible complications, prosthetic mesh usage seems to have a higher incidence of chronic pain and, sometimes, infection.[19]
</p><p>The frequency of surgical correction ranges from 10 per 100,000 (U.K.) to 28 per 100,000 (U.S.).[1]
</p><h3>Recovery[edit]</h3><p>Many people are managed through day surgery centers, and are able to return to work within a week or two, while intense activities are prohibited for a longer period. People who have their hernias repaired with mesh often recover within a month, though pain can last longer. Surgical complications include pain that lasts more than three months, surgical site infections, nerve and blood vessel injuries, injury to nearby organs, and hernia recurrence. Pain that lasts more than three months occurs in about 10% of people following hernia repair.[1]
</p>"
72,hernia hiatal,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>In the great majority of cases, sufferers experience no life-altering discomfort, and no treatment is required. If there is pain or discomfort, 3 or 4 sips of room temperature water will usually relieve the pain. Symptomatic patients should elevate the head of their beds and avoid lying down directly after meals[citation needed].  If the condition has been brought on by stress, stress reduction techniques may be prescribed, or if overweight, weight loss may be indicated.  Antisecretory drugs like proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor blockers can be used to reduce acid secretion.  Medications that reduce the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure should be avoided.
</p><p>However, in some unusual instances, as when the hiatal hernia is unusually large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it may cause esophageal stricture or severe discomfort. About 5% of hiatal hernias are paraesophageal. If symptoms from such a hernia are severe for example if chronic acid reflux threatens to severely injure the esophagus or is causing Barrett's esophagus, surgery is sometimes recommended. However surgery has its own risks including death and disability, so that even for large or paraesophageal hernias, watchful waiting may on balance be safer and cause fewer problems than surgery.[10] Complications from surgical procedures to correct a hiatal hernia may include gas bloat syndrome, dysphagia (trouble swallowing), dumping syndrome, excessive scarring, and rarely, achalasia.[10]  Surgical procedures sometimes fail over time, requiring a second surgery to make repairs.
</p><p>One surgical procedure used is called Nissen fundoplication. In fundoplication, the gastric fundus (upper part) of the stomach is wrapped, or plicated, around the inferior part of the esophagus, preventing herniation of the stomach through the hiatus in the diaphragm and the reflux of gastric acid. The procedure is now commonly performed laparoscopically. With proper patient selection, laparoscopic fundoplication recent studies have indicated relatively low complication rates, quick recovery, and relatively good long term results.[11][12][13][14][15]

73,hiv infections,"<h2>Research</h2><div>Main article: HIV/AIDS research</div><p>HIV/AIDS research includes all medical research that attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, as well as fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.
</p><p>Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions, such as research into sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and anti-retroviral drugs.[112] Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, circumcision and HIV, and accelerated aging effects.
</p><h2>Treatment and Transmission</h2><div>Main article: Management of HIV/AIDS</div><p>The management of HIV/AIDS normally includes the use of multiple antiretroviral drugs. In many parts of the world, HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare.
</p><p>HIV latency, and the consequent viral reservoir in CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, as well as macrophages, is the main barrier to eradication of the virus.[16]
</p><p>It is important to note that although HIV is highly virulent, transmission does not occur through sex when an HIV-positive person has a consistently undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ml) due to anti-retroviral treatment. Previously it was said the chance of transmission was 'very low' or 'negligable' (The 'Swiss Statement').[113] However, following multiple studies its is now clear that the chance of passing on HIV through sex is zero where the HIV-positive person has a consistently undetectable viral load, this is known as 'U=U' or 'Undetectable=Untransmittable', also phrased as 'can't pass it on'.[114][115] The studies demonstrating U=U are; Opposites Attract, PARTNER 1, PARTNER 2, and HPTN052.[116][117][118][119] In these studies couples where one partner was HIV positive and one partner was HIV negative were enrolled and regular HIV testing completed. In total from the four studies, 4097 couples were enrolled over four continents and 151,880 acts of condomless sex were reported, there were zero phylogenetically linked transmissions of HIV where the positive partner had an undetecable viral load.[120] Following this the U=U consensus statement advocating the use of 'zero risk' was signed by hundreds of individuals and organisations including the US CDC, British HIV Association and The Lancet medical journal.[121]

74,hyperbilirubinemia,"<h2>How Is It Treated?</h2><p>In adults, jaundice itself usually isn’t treated. But your doctor will treat the condition that’s causing it. If you have acute viral hepatitis, jaundice will go away on its own as the liver begins to heal. If a blocked bile duct is to blame, your doctor may suggest surgery to open it.</p>"
75,hypercholesterolemia,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>For those at high risk, a combination of lifestyle modification and statins has been shown to decrease mortality.[9]
</p><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><p>Lifestyle changes recommended for those with high cholesterol include: smoking cessation, limiting alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight.[19]
</p><p>Overweight or obese individuals can lower blood cholesterol by losing weight – on average a kilogram of weight loss can reduce LDL cholesterol by 0.8 mg/dl.[7]
</p><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>Eating a diet with a high proportion of vegetables, fruit, dietary fibre, and low in fats results in a modest decrease in total cholesterol.[43][44][7]
</p><p>Eating dietary cholesterol causes a small but significant rise in serum cholesterol.[45][46] Dietary limits for cholesterol were proposed in United States, but not in Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia.[45] Consequently, in 2015 the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee in the United States removed its recommendation of limiting cholesterol intake.[47]
</p><p>A 2015 Cochrane review found replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat resulted in a small decrease in cardiovascular disease by decreasing blood cholesterol.[48] Other reviews have not found an effect from saturated fats on cardiovascular disease.[49][6] Trans fats are recognized as a potential risk factor for cholesterol-related cardiovascular disease, and avoiding them in an adult diet is recommended.[6]
</p><p>The National Lipid Association recommends that people with familial hypercholesterolemia restrict intakes of total fat to 25–35% of energy intake, saturated fat to less than 7% of energy intake, and cholesterol to less than 200 mg per day.[7] Changes in total fat intake in low calorie diets do not appear to affect blood cholesterol.[50]
</p><p>Increasing soluble fiber consumption has been shown to reduce levels of LDL cholesterol, with each additional gram of soluble fiber reducing LDL by an average of 2.2 mg/dL (0.057 mmol/L).[51] Increasing consumption of whole grains also reduces LDL cholesterol, with whole grain oats being particularly effective.[52] Inclusion of 2 g per day of phytosterols and phytostanols and 10 to 20 g per day of soluble fiber decreases dietary cholesterol absorption.[7] A diet high in fructose can raise LDL cholesterol levels in the blood.[53]
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>Statins are the typically used medications, in addition to healthy lifestyle interventions.[54] Statins can reduce total cholesterol by about 50% in the majority of people,[36] and are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in both people with[55] and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease.[56][57][58][59] In people without cardiovascular disease, statins have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal coronary heat disease, and strokes.[60] Greater benefit is observed with the use of high-intensity statin therapy.[61] Statins may improve quality of life when used in people without existing cardiovascular disease (i.e. for primary prevention).[60] Statins decrease cholesterol in children with hypercholesterolemia, but no studies as of 2010 show improved outcomes[62] and diet is the mainstay of therapy in childhood.[36]
</p><p>Other agents that may be used include fibrates, nicotinic acid, and cholestyramine.[63] These, however, are only recommended if statins are not tolerated or in pregnant women.[63]  Injectable antibodies against the protein PCSK9 (evolocumab, bococizumab, alirocumab) can reduce LDL cholesterol and have been shown to reduce mortality.[64]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><p>According to a survey in 2002, alternative medicine was used in an attempt to treat cholesterol by 1.1% of U.S. adults. Consistent with previous surveys, this one found the majority of individuals (55%) used it in conjunction with conventional medicine.[65]
A review of trials of phytosterols and/or phytostanols, average dose 2.15 g/day, reported an average of 9% lowering of LDL-cholesterol.[66] In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved the labeling of foods containing specified amounts of phytosterol esters or phytostanol esters as cholesterol-lowering; in 2003, an FDA Interim Health Claim Rule extended that label claim to foods or dietary supplements delivering more than 0.8 g/day of phytosterols or phytostanols. Some researchers, however, are concerned about diet supplementation with plant sterol esters and draw attention to lack of long-term safety data.[67]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Various clinical practice guidelines have addressed the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
</p><p>The National Cholesterol Education Program revised their guidelines;[69] however, their 2004 revisions have been criticized for use of nonrandomized, observational data.[70]
</p><p>In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has made recommendations for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels, published in 2008.[63]
</p><p>The Task Force for the management of dyslipidaemias of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society published guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias in 2011.[36]
</p><p>Gene therapy is being studied as a potential treatment.[71][72][73]
</p>"
76,hyperglycemia,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment of hyperglycemia requires elimination of the underlying cause, such as diabetes. Acute hyperglycemia can be treated by direct administration of insulin in most cases. Severe hyperglycemia can be treated with oral hypoglycemic therapy and lifestyle modification.[16]
</p><p>In diabetes mellitus (by far the most common cause of chronic hyperglycemia), treatment aims at maintaining blood glucose at a level as close to normal as possible, in order to avoid serious long-term complications.  This is done by a combination of proper diet, regular exercise, and insulin or other medication such as metformin, etc.
</p><p>Those with hyperglycaemia can be treated using sulphonylureas or metformin or both. These drugs help by improving glycaemic control.[17]
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor alone or in combination with basal insulin can be used as a treatment for hyperglycemia with patients still in hospital. [11]
</p>"
77,hyperlipidemia,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>For treatment of type II, dietary modification is the initial approach, but many patients require treatment with statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) to reduce cardiovascular risk. If the triglyceride level is markedly raised, fibrates (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonists)  may be preferable due to their beneficial effects. Combination treatment of statins and fibrates, while highly effective, causes a markedly increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, so is only done under close supervision. Other agents commonly added to statins are ezetimibe, niacin, and bile acid sequestrants. Dietary supplementation with fish oil is also used to reduce elevated triglycerides, with the greatest effect occurring in patients with the greatest severity.[18] Some evidence exists for benefit of plant sterol-containing products and omega-3 fatty acids.[19]
</p>"
78,hypertension pulmonary,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. If it is caused by left heart disease, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of medication or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve.[65] Patients with left heart failure or hypoxemic lung diseases (groups II or III pulmonary hypertension) should not routinely be treated with vasoactive agents including prostanoids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists, as these are approved for the different condition called primary pulmonary arterial hypertension.[66] To make the distinction, doctors at a minimum will conduct cardiac catheterization of the right heart, echocardiography, chest CT, a six-minute walk test, and pulmonary function testing.[66] Using treatments for other kinds of pulmonary hypertension in patients with these conditions can harm the patient and wastes substantial medical resources.[66]
</p><p>High dose calcium channel blockers are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are vasoreactive by Swan-Ganz catheter. Unfortunately, calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality.[15] The criteria for vasoreactivity have changed. Only those patients whose mean pulmonary artery pressure falls by more than 10 mm Hg to less than 40 mm Hg with an unchanged or increased cardiac output when challenged with adenosine, epoprostenol, or nitric oxide are considered vasoreactive.[67] Of these, only half of the patients are responsive to calcium channel blockers in the long term.[68]
</p><p>A number of agents have recently been introduced for primary and secondary PAH. The trials supporting the use of these agents have been relatively small, and the only measure consistently used to compare their effectivity is the ""6 minute walk test"". Many have no data on mortality benefit or time to progression.[69]
</p><h3>Vasoactive substances[edit]</h3><p>Many pathways are involved in the abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Three of these pathways are important since they have been targeted with drugs — endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives.[70]
</p><h4>Prostaglandins[edit]</h4><p>Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is commonly considered the most effective treatment for PAH. Epoprostenol (synthetic prostacyclin) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter. This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis. Prostacyclin is unstable, and therefore has to be kept on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous, and interruption can be fatal.[71] Other prostanoids have therefore been developed. Treprostinil can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. An increased risk of sepsis with intravenous Remodulin has been reported by the CDC. Iloprost is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. Iloprost was the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe, until the inhaled form of treprostinil was approved by the FDA in July 2009.[medical citation needed]
</p><h4>Endothelin receptor antagonists[edit]</h4><p>The dual (ETA and ETB) endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was approved in 2001. Sitaxentan (Thelin) was approved for use in Canada, Australia, and the European Union,[72] but not in the United States. In 2010, Pfizer withdrew Thelin worldwide because of fatal liver complications. A similar drug, ambrisentan is marketed as Letairis in the U.S. by Gilead Sciences.[73]
</p><h4>Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors[edit]</h4><p>The U.S. FDA approved sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), for the treatment of PAH in 2005. It is marketed for PAH as Revatio. In 2009, they also approved tadalafil, another PDE5 inhibitor, marketed under the name Adcirca.[74] PDE5 inhibitors are believed to increase pulmonary artery vasodilation, and inhibit vascular remodeling, thus lowering pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance.[75]
</p><p>Tadalafil is taken orally, as well as sildenafil, and it is rapidly absorbed (serum levels are detectable at 20 minutes). The T1/2 (biological half-life) hovers around 17.5 hours in healthy subjects.[76] Moreover, if we consider pharmacoeconomic implications, patients that take tadalafil would pay two-thirds of the cost of sildenafil therapy.[77] However, there are some adverse effects of this drug such as headache, diarrhea, nausea, back pain, dyspepsia, flushing and myalgia.[78]
</p><h4>Activators of soluble guanylate cyclase[edit]</h4><p>Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the intracellular receptor for NO. As of April 2009[update], the sGC activators cinaciguat and riociguat were undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of PAH.[79]
</p><h3>Surgical[edit]</h3><p>Atrial septostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a communication between the right and left atria. It relieves pressure on the right side of the heart, but at the cost of lower oxygen levels in blood (hypoxia). Lung transplantation cures pulmonary arterial hypertension, but leaves the patient with the complications of transplantation, and a post-surgical median survival of just over five years.[80]
</p><p>Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is a surgical procedure that is used for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. It is the surgical removal of an organized thrombus (clot) along with the lining of the pulmonary artery; it is a very difficult, major procedure that is currently performed in a few select centers.[81]
</p><h3>Monitoring[edit]</h3><p>Established clinical practice guidelines dictate the frequency of pulmonary nodule evaluation and surveillance,[66][82]
patients are normally monitored through commonly available tests such as:[citation needed]
</p><div>
Pulse oximetry
Arterial blood gas tests
Chest X-rays
Serial ECG tests
Serial echocardiography
Spirometry or more advanced lung function studies
6-minute walk test[83]</div><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>For people that inherited the disease, gene therapy is being researched.[104]

79,hypertensive disease,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Much of the disease burden of high blood pressure is experienced by people who are not labeled as hypertensive.[87] Consequently, population strategies are required to reduce the consequences of high blood pressure and reduce the need for antihypertensive medications. Lifestyle changes are recommended to lower blood pressure, before starting medications. The 2004 British Hypertension Society guidelines[87] proposed lifestyle changes consistent with those outlined by the US National High BP Education Program in 2002[95] for the primary prevention of hypertension:
</p><ul>maintain normal body weight for adults (e.g. body mass index 20–25 kg/m2)
reduce dietary sodium intake to <100 mmol/ day (<6 g of sodium chloride or <2.4 g of sodium per day)
engage in regular aerobic physical activity such as brisk walking (≥30 min per day, most days of the week)
limit alcohol consumption to no more than 3 units/day in men and no more than 2 units/day in women
consume a diet rich in fruit and vegetables (e.g. at least five portions per day);</ul><p>Effective lifestyle modification may lower blood pressure as much as an individual antihypertensive medication. Combinations of two or more lifestyle modifications can achieve even better results.[87] There is considerable evidence that reducing dietary salt intake lowers blood pressure, but whether this translates into a reduction in mortality and cardiovascular disease remains uncertain.[96] Estimated sodium intake ≥6g/day and <3g/day are both associated with high risk of death or major cardiovascular disease, but the association between high sodium intake and adverse outcomes is only observed in people with hypertension.[97] Consequently, in the absence of results from randomized controlled trials, the wisdom of reducing levels of dietary salt intake below 3g/day has been questioned.[96] ESC guidelines mention periodontitis is associated with poor cardiovascular health status.[98]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of hypertension</div><p>According to one review published in 2003, reduction of the blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischemic heart disease by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease.[99]
</p><h3>Target blood pressure[edit]</h3><div>See also: Comparison of international blood pressure guidelines</div><p>Various expert groups have produced guidelines regarding how low the blood pressure target should be when a person is treated for hypertension. These groups recommend a target below the range 140–160 / 90–100 mmHg for the general population.[13][12][100][101][102] Cochrane reviews recommend similar targets for subgroups such as people with diabetes[103] and people with prior cardiovascular disease.[104]
</p><p>Many expert groups recommend a slightly higher target of 150/90 mmHg for those over somewhere between 60 and 80 years of age.[12][100][101][105] The JNC-8 and American College of Physicians recommend the target of 150/90 mmHg for those over 60 years of age,[13][106] but some experts within these groups disagree with this recommendation.[107] Some expert groups have also recommended slightly lower targets in those with diabetes[12] or chronic kidney disease with protein loss in the urine,[108] but others recommend the same target as for the general population.[13][103] The issue of what is the best target and whether targets should differ for high risk individuals is unresolved,[109] although some experts propose more intensive blood pressure lowering than advocated in some guidelines.[110]
</p><p>For people who have never experienced cardiovascular disease who are at a 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease of less than 10%, the 2017 American Heart Association guidelines recommend medications if the systolic blood pressure is >140 mmHg or if the diastolic BP is >90 mmHg.[7] For people who have experienced cardiovascular disease or those who are at a 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease of greater than 10%, it recommends medications if the systolic blood pressure is >130 mmHg or if the diastolic BP is >80 mmHg.[7]
</p><h3>Lifestyle modifications[edit]</h3><p>The first line of treatment for hypertension is lifestyle changes, including dietary changes, physical exercise, and weight loss. Though these have all been recommended in scientific advisories,[111] a  Cochrane systematic review found no evidence for effects of weight loss diets on death, long-term complications or adverse events in persons with hypertension.[112] The review did find a decrease in blood pressure.[112] Their potential effectiveness is similar to and at times exceeds a single medication.[12] If hypertension is high enough to justify immediate use of medications, lifestyle changes are still recommended in conjunction with medication.
</p><p>Dietary changes shown to reduce blood pressure include diets with low sodium,[113][114][115] the DASH diet,[116] vegetarian diets,[117] and green tea consumption.[118][119][120][121]
</p><p>Increasing dietary potassium has a potential benefit for lowering the risk of hypertension.[122][123] The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) stated that potassium is one of the shortfall nutrients which is under-consumed in the United States.[124] However, people who take certain antihypertensive medications (such as ACE-inhibitors or ARBs) should not take potassium supplements or potassium-enriched salts due to the risk of high levels of potassium.[125]
</p><p>Physical exercise regimens which are shown to reduce blood pressure include isometric resistance exercise, aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and device-guided breathing.[126]
</p><p>Stress reduction techniques such as biofeedback or transcendental meditation may be considered as an add-on to other treatments to reduce hypertension, but do not have evidence for preventing cardiovascular disease on their own.[126][127][128] Self-monitoring and appointment reminders might support the use of other strategies to improve blood pressure control, but need further evaluation.[129]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as antihypertensive medications, are available for treating hypertension.
</p><p>First-line medications for hypertension include thiazide-diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).[13] These medications may be used alone or in combination (ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended for use in combination); the latter option may serve to minimize counter-regulatory mechanisms that act to restore blood pressure values to pre-treatment levels.[13][130] Most people require more than one medication to control their hypertension.[111] Medications for blood pressure control should be implemented by a stepped care approach when target levels are not reached.[129]
</p><p>Previously beta-blockers such as atenolol were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, a Cochrane review that included 13 trials found that the effects of beta-blockers are inferior to that of other antihypertensive medications in preventing cardiovascular disease.[131]
</p><h3>Resistant hypertension[edit]</h3><p>Resistant hypertension is defined as high blood pressure that remains above a target level, in spite of being prescribed three or more antihypertensive drugs simultaneously with different mechanisms of action.[132] Failing to take the prescribed drugs, is an important cause of resistant hypertension.[133] Resistant hypertension may also result from chronically high activity of the autonomic nervous system, an effect known as ""neurogenic hypertension"".[134] Electrical therapies that stimulate the baroreflex are being studied as an option for lowering blood pressure in people in this situation.[135]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>A 2015 review of several studies found that restoring blood vitamin D levels by using supplements (more than 1,000 IU per day) reduced blood pressure in hypertensive individuals when they had existing vitamin D deficiency.[168] The results also demonstrated a correlation of chronically low vitamin D levels with a higher chance of becoming hypertensive. Supplementation with vitamin D over 18 months in normotensive individuals with vitamin D deficiency did not significantly affect blood pressure.[168]
</p><p>There is tentative evidence that an increased calcium intake may help in preventing hypertension. However, more studies are needed to assess the optimal dose and the possible side effects.[169]
</p>"
80,hypoglycemia,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>The most effective means of preventing further episodes of hypoglycemia depends on the cause.
</p><p>The risk of further episodes of diabetic hypoglycemia can often (but not always) be reduced by lowering the dose of insulin or other medications, or by more meticulous attention to blood sugar balance during unusual hours, higher levels of exercise, or decreasing alcohol intake.
</p><p>Many of the inborn errors of metabolism require avoidance or shortening of fasting intervals, or extra carbohydrates. For the more severe disorders, such as type 1 glycogen storage disease, this may be supplied in the form of cornstarch every few hours or by continuous gastric infusion.
</p><p>Several treatments are used for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, depending on the exact form and severity. Some forms of congenital hyperinsulinism respond to diazoxide or octreotide. Surgical removal of the overactive part of the pancreas is curative with minimal risk when hyperinsulinism is focal or due to a benign insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas. When congenital hyperinsulinism is diffuse and refractory to medications, near-total pancreatectomy may be the treatment of last resort, but in this condition is less consistently effective and fraught with more complications.
</p><p>Hypoglycemia due to hormone deficiencies such as hypopituitarism or adrenal insufficiency usually ceases when the appropriate hormone is replaced.
</p><p>Hypoglycemia due to dumping syndrome and other post-surgical conditions is best dealt with by altering diet. Including fat and protein with carbohydrates may slow digestion and reduce early insulin secretion. Some forms of this respond to treatment with an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, which slows starch digestion.
</p><p>Reactive hypoglycemia with demonstrably low blood glucose levels is most often a predictable nuisance which can be avoided by consuming fat and protein with carbohydrates, by adding morning or afternoon snacks, and reducing alcohol intake.
</p><p>Idiopathic postprandial syndrome without demonstrably low glucose levels at the time of symptoms can be more of a management challenge. Many people find improvement by changing eating patterns (smaller meals, avoiding excessive sugar, mixed meals rather than carbohydrates by themselves), reducing intake of stimulants such as caffeine, or by making lifestyle changes to reduce stress. See the following section of this article.
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment of some forms of hypoglycemia, such as in diabetes, involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal through the eating of carbohydrates such as sugars, determining the cause, and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes. However, this treatment is not optimal in other forms such as reactive hypoglycemia, where rapid carbohydrate ingestion may lead to a further hypoglycemic episode.
</p><p>Blood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking (or receiving) 10–20 grams of carbohydrate.[31] It can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow. This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 3–4 ounces (100–120 ml) of orange, apple, or grape juice although fruit juices contain a higher proportion of fructose which is more slowly metabolized than pure dextrose. Alternatively, about 4–5 ounces (120–150 ml) of regular (non-diet) soda may also work, as will about one slice of bread, about 4 crackers, or about 1 serving of most starchy foods. Starch is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking acarbose), but adding fat or protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full recovery may take 10–20 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery and if the person has diabetes will simply produce hyperglycemia afterwards.  A mnemonic used by the American Diabetes Association and others is the ""rule of 15"" – consuming 15 grams of carbohydrate followed by a 15-minute wait, repeated if glucose remains low (variable by individual, sometimes 70 mg/dL).[32]
</p><p>If a person has such severe effects of hypoglycemia that they cannot (due to combativeness) or should not (due to seizures or unconsciousness) be given anything by mouth, medical personnel such as paramedics, or in-hospital personnel can establish IV access and give intravenous dextrose, concentrations varying depending on age (infants are given 2 ml/kg dextrose 10%, children are given dextrose 25%, and adults are given dextrose 50%). Care must be taken in giving these solutions because they can cause skin necrosis if the IV is infiltrated, sclerosis of veins, and many other fluid and electrolyte disturbances if administered incorrectly. If IV access cannot be established, the patient can be given 1 to 2 milligrams of glucagon in an intramuscular injection. More treatment information can be found in the article diabetic hypoglycemia.  If a person has less severe effects, and is conscious with the ability to swallow, medical personal may administer gelatinous oral glucose. The soft drink Lucozade has been used for hypoglycemia in the United Kingdom, however it has recently replaced much of its glucose with the artificial sugars, which do not treat hypoglycemia.[33]
</p><p>One situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is taking acarbose. Since acarbose and other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors prevents starch and other sugars from being broken down into monosaccharides that can be absorbed by the body, patients taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as glucose tablets, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia.

81,hypothyroidism,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div> A 3-month-old infant with untreated congenital hypothyroidism showing myxedematous facies, a big tongue, and skin mottling</div><p>Hypothyroidism may be prevented in a population by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI).[40] Encouraged by the World Health Organization,[41] 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread.[40] Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries as a result of attempts to reduce salt intake.[40]
</p><p>Pregnant and breastfeeding women, who require 66% more daily iodine requirement than non-pregnant women, may still not be getting enough iodine.[40][42] The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 250 µg for pregnant and breastfeeding women.[43] As many women will not achieve this from dietary sources alone, the American Thyroid Association recommends a 150 µg daily supplement by mouth.[31][44]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><h3>Hormone replacement[edit]</h3><p>Most people with hypothyroidism symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency are treated with a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine).[7][14] In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications.[7][25] Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.[7]
</p><p>Blood free thyroxine and TSH levels are monitored to help determine whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks after the start of treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms.[7] Normalization of TSH does not mean that other abnormalities associated with hypothyroidism improve entirely, such as elevated cholesterol levels.[49]
</p><p>In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level.[7][9] Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food,[7] as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine.[50] There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.[14]
</p><h4>Liothyronine[edit]</h4><p>Adding liothyronine (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine has been suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but this has not been confirmed by studies.[8][14][51] In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone.[14][52] Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy due to a lack of evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment.[7] Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.[7]
</p><p>People with hypothyroidism who do not feel well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered with regards to the chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine.[53] The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.[53]
</p><h4>Desiccated animal thyroid[edit]</h4><p>Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based thyroid gland extract,[14] most commonly from pigs. It is a combination therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3.[14] It also contains calcitonin (a hormone produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication.[54] This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence;[8][14] British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use.[7][52]
</p><h3>Subclinical hypothyroidism[edit]</h3><p>There is little evidence whether there is a benefit from treating subclinical hypothyroidism, and whether this offsets the risks of overtreatment. Untreated subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary artery disease.[55] A 2007 review found no benefit of thyroid hormone replacement except for ""some parameters of lipid profiles and left ventricular function"".[56] There is no association between subclinical hypothyroidism and an increased risk of bone fractures,[57] nor is there a link with cognitive decline.[58]
</p><p>Since 2008, consensus American and British opinion has been that in general people with TSH under 10 mIU/l do not require treatment.[7][36][59] American guidelines recommend that treatment should be considered in people with symptoms of hypothyroidism, detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, a history of heart disease or are at an increased risk for heart disease, if the TSH is elevated but below 10 mIU/l.[7]
</p><h3>Myxedema coma[edit]</h3><p>Myxedema coma or severe decompensated hypothyroidism usually requires admission to the intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists.[16] For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low to be able to safely swallow medication.[16] While administration through a nasogastric tube is possible, this may be unsafe and is discouraged.[16]
</p><h3>Pregnancy[edit]</h3><p>In women with known hypothyroidism who become pregnant, it is recommended that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5 mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0 mIU/L.[14][31] Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy.[7] The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed,[7][25][31] although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.[60]
</p><p>Women with anti-TPO antibodies who are trying to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past.[7] Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage.[61] The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10 mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended.[7][31] If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended.[31] It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, in the sense that the TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.[60]
</p>"
82,ileus,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Traditionally, nothing by mouth was considered to be mandatory in all cases, but gentle feeding by enteral feeding tube may help to restore motility by triggering the gut's normal feedback signals, so this is the recommended management initially.[7] When the patient has severe, persistent signs that motility is completely disrupted, nasogastric suction and parenteral nutrition may be required until passage is restored. In such cases, continuing aggressive enteral feeding causes a risk of perforating the gut.
</p><p>Several options are available in the case of paralytic ileus. Most treatment is supportive. If caused by medication, the offending agent is discontinued or reduced. Bowel movements may be stimulated by prescribing lactulose, erythromycin or, in severe cases that are thought to have a neurological component (such as Ogilvie's syndrome), neostigmine. There is also evidence from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that chewing gum, as a form of 'sham feeding', may stimulate gastrointestinal motility in the post-operative period and reduce the duration of postoperative ileus.[8]
</p><p>If possible the underlying cause is corrected (e.g. replace electrolytes).
</p>"
83,incontinence,"<h2>Surgery</h2><p>If other methods for helping stress incontinence don’t work, your doctor might recommend surgery. These operations have very high success rates.</p><ul>

Sling procedure. This is the most common. Your doctor will fashion a “hammock” using mesh and tissue to support your urethra. It can be done as outpatient surgery using local anesthesia. This means you will be awake during the procedure and go home the same day.

Retropubic colposuspension. Your doctor might choose this method, along with a combo of others, if your bladder has dropped -- your doctor might use the term “prolapsed.” He’ll use stitches (sutures) to lift up and support tissues at the entrance to your bladder.
</ul><p> </p>"
84,infection,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div> Washing one's hands, a form of hygiene, is an effective way to prevent the spread of infectious disease.[27]</div><p>Techniques like hand washing, wearing gowns, and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another. Aseptic technique was introduced in medicine and surgery in the late 19th century and greatly reduced the incidence of infections caused by surgery. Frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms.[28] There are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs, using a condom, wearing gloves, and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise. Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important.
</p><p>Antimicrobial substances used to prevent transmission of infections include:
</p><ul>antiseptics, which are applied to living tissue/skin
disinfectants, which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.
antibiotics, called prophylactic when given as prevention rather as treatment of infection. However, long term use of antibiotics leads to resistance of bacteria. While humans do not become immune to antibiotics, the bacteria does. Thus, avoiding using antibiotics longer than necessary helps preventing bacteria from forming mutations that aide in antibiotic resistance.</ul><p>One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases.[29] Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of Ebola virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone.[30] Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system.[9] As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic.
</p><p>Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks.[29] In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method. [6][full citation needed] Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001.[31]
</p><p>A general method to prevent transmission of vector-borne pathogens is pest control.
</p><h3>Immunity[edit]</h3><div> Mary Mallon (a.k.a. Typhoid Mary) was an asymptomatic carrier of typhoid fever. Over the course of her career as a cook, she infected 53 people, three of whom died.</div><p>Infection with most pathogens does not result in death of the host and the offending organism is ultimately cleared after the symptoms of the disease have waned.[8] This process requires immune mechanisms to kill or inactivate the inoculum of the pathogen. Specific acquired immunity against infectious diseases may be mediated by antibodies and/or T lymphocytes. Immunity mediated by these two factors may be manifested by:
</p><ul>a direct effect upon a pathogen, such as antibody-initiated complement-dependent bacteriolysis, opsonoization, phagocytosis and killing, as occurs for some bacteria,
neutralization of viruses so that these organisms cannot enter cells,
or by T lymphocytes, which will kill a cell parasitized by a microorganism.</ul><p>The immune system response to a microorganism often causes symptoms such as a high fever and inflammation, and has the potential to be more devastating than direct damage caused by a microbe.[9]
</p><p>Resistance to infection (immunity) may be acquired following a disease, by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen, by harboring an organism with a similar structure (crossreacting), or by vaccination. Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens.
There is also the phenomenon of herd immunity which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections.
</p><p>Immune resistance to an infectious disease requires a critical level of either antigen-specific antibodies and/or T cells when the host encounters the pathogen. Some individuals develop natural serum antibodies to the surface polysaccharides of some agents although they have had little or no contact with the agent, these natural antibodies confer specific protection to adults and are passively transmitted to newborns.
</p><h4>Host genetic factors[edit]</h4><p>The organism that is the target of an infecting action of a specific infectious agent is called the host. The host harbouring an agent that is in a mature or sexually active stage phase is called the definitive host. The intermediate host comes in contact during the larvae stage. A host can be anything living and can attain to asexual and sexual reproduction.[32]
The clearance of the pathogens, either treatment-induced or spontaneous, it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients. For instance, for genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b (brand names Pegasys or PEG-Intron) combined with ribavirin, it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in the treatment-induced clearance of the virus. This finding, originally reported in Nature,[33] showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others. Later report from Nature[34] demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus.
</p><h2>Treatments[edit]</h2><p>When infection attacks the body, anti-infective drugs can suppress the infection. Several broad types of anti-infective drugs exist, depending on the type of organism targeted; they include antibacterial (antibiotic; including antitubercular), antiviral, antifungal and antiparasitic (including antiprotozoal and antihelminthic) agents. Depending on the severity and the type of infection, the antibiotic may be given by mouth or by injection, or may be applied topically. Severe infections of the brain are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics. Sometimes, multiple antibiotics are used in case there is resistance to one antibiotic. Antibiotics only work for bacteria and do not affect viruses. Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria. The most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include penicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones and tetracyclines.[citation needed]
</p><p>Not all infections require treatment, and for many self-limiting infections the treatment may cause more side-effects than benefits. Antimicrobial stewardship is the concept that healthcare providers should treat an infection with an antimicrobial that specifically works well for the target pathogen for the shortest amount of time and to only treat when there is a known or highly suspected pathogen that will respond to the medication.[35]
</p>"
85,infection urinary tract,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers.[4] There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching.[29] In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.[6] In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.[49]
</p><p>Using urinary catheters as little and as short of time as possible and appropriate care of the catheter when used prevents catheter-associated urinary tract infections.[32]
They should be inserted using sterile technique in hospital however non-sterile technique may be appropriate in those who self catheterize.[34] The urinary catheter set up should also be kept sealed.[34] Evidence does not support a significant decrease in risk when silver-alloy catheters are used.[50]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>For those with recurrent infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs is associated with the lowest antibiotic use.[16] A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective.[4] Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX).[6] Methenamine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop.[51] Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of antibiotic resistance.[16]
</p><p>In cases where infections are related to intercourse, taking antibiotics afterwards may be useful.[6] In post-menopausal women, topical vaginal estrogen has been found to reduce recurrence.[52][53] As opposed to topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics.[53] Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection.[54] A number of vaccines are in development as of 2018.[55][56]
</p><h3>Children</h3><p>The evidence that preventive antibiotics decrease urinary tract infections in children is poor.[57] However recurrent UTIs are a rare cause of further kidney problems if there are no underlying abnormalities of the kidneys, resulting in less than a third of a percent (0.33%) of chronic kidney disease in adults.[58] Whether routine circumcision prevents UTIs has not been well studied as of 2011.[59]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>Some research suggests that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections.[52][60] A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small.[61] Long-term tolerance is also an issue[61] with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%.[62] Cranberry juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication.[61] As of 2015, probiotics require further study to determine if they are beneficial.[63] The role of the urinary microbiome in maintaining urinary tract health is not well understood as of 2015.[64][65][66]
</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The mainstay of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed during the first few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection.[67] However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood).[68] Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers.[69] There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.[70][71]
</p><h3>Asymptomatic bacteriuria</h3><p>Those who have bacteria in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics.[72] This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, and those who have urinary catheters.[73][74] Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7 days of antibiotics.[75][76] If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth.[77] Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus[78] and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.[74]
</p><h3>Uncomplicated</h3><p>Uncomplicated infections can be diagnosed and treated based on symptoms alone.[4] Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line.[79] Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone may also be used.[80] However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing.[41] The FDA recommends against the use of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects.[81] These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective.[80][82] A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7 days.[4][83] Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.[41]
</p><p>With treatment, symptoms should improve within 36 hours.[17] About 50% of people will recover without treatment within a few days or weeks.[4] Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment.[41][84] The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication.[83] Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options.[85] Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these medications related to their widespread use.[4] Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries.[83] For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics.[86] Women with recurrent simple UTIs are over 90% accurate in identifying new infections.[4] They may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.[4]
</p><h3>Complicated</h3><p>Complicated UTIs are more difficult to treat and usually requires more aggressive evaluation, treatment and follow-up.[87] It may require identifying and addressing the underlying complication.[88] Increasing antibiotic resistance is causing concern about the future of treating those with complicated and recurrent UTI.[89][90]
</p><h3>Pyelonephritis</h3><p>Pyelonephritis is treated more aggressively than a simple bladder infection using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics.[3] Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used in areas where the resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed.[3] Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option.[91] In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed.[3] Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.[9][3]
</p>"
86,insufficiency renal,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>In non-diabetics and people with type 1 diabetes, a low protein diet is found to have a preventative effect on progression of chronic kidney disease. However, this effect does not apply to people with type 2 diabetes.[33] A whole food, plant-based diet may help some people with kidney disease.[34] A high protein diet from either animal or plant sources appears to have negative effects on kidney function at least in the short term.[35]
</p><h3>Slowing progression[edit]</h3><p>People who received earlier referrals to a nephrology specialist, meaning a longer time before they had to start dialysis, had a shorter initial hospitalization and reduced risk of death after the start of dialysis.[36] The authors highlighted the resulting importance of early referral in slowing progression of chronic kidney disease.[36] Other methods of reducing disease progression include minimizing exposure to nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs and intravenous contrast.[37]
</p>"
87,ischemia,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Early treatment is essential to keep the affected limb viable. The treatment options include injection of an anticoagulant, thrombolysis, embolectomy, surgical revascularisation, or partial amputation. Anticoagulant therapy is initiated to prevent further enlargement of the thrombus. Continuous IV unfractionated heparin has been the traditional agent of choice.[5]
</p><p>If the condition of the ischemic limb is stabilized with anticoagulation, recently formed emboli may be treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis using intra-arterial infusion of a thrombolytic agent (e.g., recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, or urokinase). A percutaneous catheter inserted into the femoral artery and threaded to the site of the clot is used to infuse the drug. Unlike anticoagulants, thrombolytic agents work directly to resolve the clot over a period of 24 to 48 hours.[5]
</p><p>Direct arteriotomy may be necessary to remove the clot. Surgical revascularization may be used in the setting of trauma (e.g., laceration of the artery). Amputation is reserved for cases where limb salvage is not possible. If the patient continues to have a risk of further embolization from some persistent source, such as chronic atrial fibrillation, treatment includes long-term oral anticoagulation to prevent further acute arterial ischemic episodes.[5]
</p><p>Decrease in body temperature reduces the aerobic metabolic rate of the affected cells, reducing the immediate effects of hypoxia.  Reduction of body temperature also reduces the inflammation response and reperfusion injury. For frostbite injuries, limiting thawing and warming of tissues until warmer temperatures can be sustained may reduce reperfusion injury.
</p>"
88,ketoacidosis diabetic,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Attacks of DKA can be prevented in those known to have diabetes to an extent by adherence to ""sick day rules""; these are clear-cut instructions to person on how to treat themselves when unwell. Instructions include advice on how much extra insulin to take when sugar levels appear uncontrolled, an easily digestible diet rich in salt and carbohydrates, means to suppress fever and treat infection, and recommendations when to call for medical help.[3][10]
</p><p>People with diabetes can monitor their own ketone levels when unwell and seek help if they are elevated.[20]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>The main aims in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis are replacing the lost fluids and electrolytes while suppressing the high blood sugars and ketone production with insulin. Admission to an intensive care unit or similar high-dependency area or ward for close observation may be necessary.[10]
</p><h3>Fluid replacement[edit]</h3><p>The amount of fluid replaced depends on the estimated degree of dehydration. If dehydration is so severe as to cause shock (severely decreased blood pressure with insufficient blood supply to the body's organs), or a depressed level of consciousness, rapid infusion of saline (1 liter for adults, 10 ml/kg in repeated doses for children) is recommended to restore circulating volume.[3][21] Slower rehydration based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if the dehydration is moderate, and again saline is the recommended fluid.[20][21] Very mild ketoacidosis with no associated vomiting and mild dehydration may be treated with oral rehydration and subcutaneous rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration.[21]
</p><p>A special but unusual consideration is cardiogenic shock, where the blood pressure is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.[3]
</p><h3>Insulin[edit]</h3><p>Some guidelines recommend a bolus (initial large dose) of insulin of 0.1 unit of insulin per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered immediately after the potassium level is known to be higher than 3.3 mmol/l; if the level is any lower, administering insulin could lead to a dangerously low potassium level (see below).[3][10] Other guidelines recommend delaying the initiation of insulin until fluids have been administered.[21] It is possible to use rapid acting insulin analogs injections under the skin for mild or moderate cases.[22]
</p><p>In general, insulin is given at 0.1 unit/kg per hour to reduce the blood sugars and suppress ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6 mmol/l (300 mg/dl)[3] but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.[10][20][21]
</p><h3>Potassium[edit]</h3><p>Potassium levels can fluctuate severely during the treatment of DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A large part of the shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended,[21] as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3 mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3 mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.[3]
</p><h3>Bicarbonate[edit]</h3><p>The administration of sodium bicarbonate solution to rapidly improve the acid levels in the blood is controversial. There is little evidence that it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence that while it may improve the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body's cells and increase the risk of certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged,[10][16][20] although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0).[3]
</p><h3>Cerebral edema[edit]</h3><p>Cerebral edema, if associated with coma, often necessitates admission to intensive care, artificial ventilation, and close observation. The administration of fluids is slowed. The ideal treatment of cerebral edema in DKA is not established, but intravenous mannitol and hypertonic saline (3%) are used—as in some other forms of cerebral edema—in an attempt to reduce the swelling.[16]
</p><h3>Resolution[edit]</h3><p>Resolution of DKA is defined as general improvement in the symptoms, such as the ability to tolerate oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH>7.3), and absence of ketones in blood (<1 mmol/l) or urine. Once this has been achieved, insulin may be switched to the usual subcutaneously administered regimen, one hour after which the intravenous administration can be discontinued.[10][21]
</p><p>In people with suspected ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, determination of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet cells may aid in the decision whether to continue insulin administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or whether to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes.[12] Generally speaking, routine measurement of C-peptide as a measure of insulin production is not recommended unless there is genuine doubt as to whether someone has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.[20]

89,kidney disease,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Kidney transplantation</div><p>Millions of people across the world suffer from kidney disease. Of those millions, several thousand will need dialysis or a kidney transplant at its end-stage.[21] In the United States, as of 2008, 16,500 people needed a kidney transplant.[21] Of those, 5,000 died while waiting for a transplant.[21] Currently, there is a shortage of donors, and in 2007 there were only 64,606 kidney transplants in the world.[21] This shortage of donors is causing countries to place monetary value on kidneys.  Countries such as Iran and Singapore are eliminating their lists by paying their citizens to donate.  Also, the black market accounts for 5-10 percent of transplants that occur worldwide.[21]  The act of buying an organ through the black market is illegal in the United States.[22]   To be put on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, patients must first be referred by a physician, then they must choose and contact a donor hospital.  Once they choose a donor hospital, patients must then receive an evaluation to make sure they are sustainable to receive a transplant. In order to be a match for a kidney transplant, patients must match blood type and human leukocyte antigen factors with their donors. They must also have no reactions to the antibodies from the donor's kidneys.[23][21]

90,kidney failure acute,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The management of AKI hinges on identification and treatment of the underlying cause. The main objectives of initial management are to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death and to call for specialist advice from a nephrologist. In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, management of AKI routinely includes the avoidance of substances that are toxic to the kidneys, called nephrotoxins. These include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen, iodinated contrasts such as those used for CT scans, many antibiotics such as gentamicin, and a range of other substances.[17]
</p><p>Monitoring of kidney function, by serial serum creatinine measurements and monitoring of urine output, is routinely performed. In the hospital, insertion of a urinary catheter helps monitor urine output and relieves possible bladder outlet obstruction, such as with an enlarged prostate.
</p><h3>Prerenal[edit]</h3><p>In prerenal AKI without fluid overload, administration of intravenous fluids is typically the first step to improving kidney function. Volume status may be monitored with the use of a central venous catheter to avoid over- or under-replacement of fluid.
</p><p>If low blood pressure persists despite providing a person with adequate amounts of intravenous fluid, medications that increase blood pressure (vasopressors) such as norepinephrine and in certain circumstances medications that improve the heart's ability to pump (known as inotropes) such as dobutamine may be given to improve blood flow to the kidney. While a useful vasopressor, there is no evidence to suggest that dopamine is of any specific benefit and may be harmful.[18]
</p><h3>Intrinsic[edit]</h3><p>The myriad causes of intrinsic AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to vasculitis or glomerulonephritis may respond to steroid medication, cyclophosphamide, and (in some cases) plasma exchange. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as ACE inhibitors, ARB antagonists, aminoglycosides, penicillins, NSAIDs, or paracetamol.[7]
</p><p>The use of diuretics such as furosemide, is widespread and sometimes convenient in improving fluid overload. It is not associated with higher mortality (risk of death),[19] nor with any reduced mortality or length of intensive care unit or hospital stay.[20]
</p><h3>Postrenal[edit]</h3><p>If the cause is obstruction of the urinary tract, relief of the obstruction (with a nephrostomy or urinary catheter) may be necessary.
</p><h3>Renal replacement therapy[edit]</h3><p>Renal replacement therapy, such as with hemodialysis, may be instituted in some cases of AKI. Renal replacement therapy can be applied intermittently (IRRT) and continuously (CRRT). Study results regarding differences in outcomes between IRRT and CRRT are inconsistent. A systematic review of the literature in 2008 demonstrated no difference in outcomes between the use of intermittent hemodialysis and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) (a type of continuous hemodialysis).[21] Among critically ill patients, intensive renal replacement therapy with CVVH does not appear to improve outcomes compared to less intensive intermittent hemodialysis.[17][22] However, other studies demonstrated that compared with IRRT, initiation of CRRT is associated with a lower likelihood of chronic dialysis.[23][24]
</p><h3>Complications[edit]</h3><p>Metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary edema may require medical treatment with sodium bicarbonate, antihyperkalemic measures, and diuretics.
</p><p>Lack of improvement with fluid resuscitation, therapy-resistant hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or fluid overload may necessitate artificial support in the form of dialysis or hemofiltration.[5]

92,lymphoma,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Prognoses and treatments are different for HL and between all the different forms of NHL,[46] and also depend on the grade of tumour, referring to how quickly a cancer replicates. Paradoxically, high-grade lymphomas are more readily treated and have better prognoses:[citation needed] Burkitt lymphoma, for example, is a high-grade tumour known to double within days, and is highly responsive to treatment. Lymphomas may be curable if detected in early stages with modern treatment.
</p><h3>Low-grade[edit]</h3><p>Many low-grade lymphomas remain indolent for many years. Treatment of the nonsymptomatic patient is often avoided. In these forms of lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma, watchful waiting is often the initial course of action. This is carried out because the harms and risks of treatment outweigh the benefits.[47] If a low-grade lymphoma is becoming symptomatic, radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatments of choice; although they do not cure the lymphoma, they can alleviate the symptoms, particularly painful lymphadenopathy. Patients with these types of lymphoma can live near-normal lifespans, but the disease is incurable. Some centers advocate the use of single agent rituximab in the treatment of follicular lymphoma rather than the wait and watch approach. Watchful waiting is not a good strategy for all patients, as it leads to significant distress and anxiety in some patients. It has been equated with watch and worry.[48]
</p><h3>High-grade[edit]</h3><p>Treatment of some other, more aggressive, forms of lymphoma[which?] can result in a cure in the majority of cases, but the prognosis for patients with a poor response to therapy is worse.[49] Treatment for these types of lymphoma typically consists of aggressive chemotherapy, including the CHOP or R-CHOP regimen. A number of people are cured with first-line chemotherapy. Most relapses occur within the first two years, and the relapse risk drops significantly thereafter.[50] For people who relapse, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is a proven approach.[51]
</p><h4>Hodgkin lymphoma[edit]</h4><p>Hodgkin lymphoma typically is treated with radiotherapy alone, as long as it is localized.[52]
</p><p>Advanced Hodgkin disease requires systemic chemotherapy, sometimes combined with radiotherapy.[53] Chemotherapy used includes the ABVD regimen, which is commonly used in the United States. Other regimens used in the management of Hodgkin lymphoma include BEACOPP and Stanford V. Considerable controversy exists regarding the use of ABVD or BEACOPP. Briefly, both regimens are effective, but BEACOPP is associated with more toxicity. Encouragingly, a significant number of people who relapse after ABVD can still be salvaged by stem cell transplant.[54]
</p><h3>Palliative care[edit]</h3><p>Palliative care, a specialized medical care focused on the symptoms, pain, and stress of a serious illness, is recommended by multiple national cancer treatment guidelines as an accompaniment to curative treatments for people suffering from lymphoma.[55][56]  It is used to address both the direct symptoms of lymphoma and many unwanted side effects that arise from treatments.[57][58]  Palliative care can be especially helpful for children who develop lymphoma, helping both children and their families deal with the physical and emotional symptoms of the disease.[57][59][60][61] For these reasons, palliative care is especially important for patients requiring bone marrow transplants.[62][63]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>The two types of lymphoma research are clinical or translational research and basic research. Clinical/translational research focuses on studying the disease in a defined and generally immediately patient-applicable way, such as testing a new drug in patients.  Studies may focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, improving the quality of life for patients, or appropriate care in remission or after cures. Hundreds of clinical trials are being planned or conducted at any given time.[68]
</p><p>Basic science research studies the disease process at a distance, such as seeing whether a suspected carcinogen can cause healthy cells to turn into lymphoma cells in the laboratory or how the DNA changes inside lymphoma cells as the disease progresses.  The results from basic research studies are generally less immediately useful to patients with the disease,[69] but can improve scientists' understanding of lymphoma and form the foundation for future, more effective treatments.

93,malignant neoplasm of breast,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><p>Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[89] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil and 20% in China.[89] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking  are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[89][90] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[91] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[28]
</p><p>High intake of citrus fruit has been associated with a 10% reduction in the risk of breast cancer.[92]
</p><p>Marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids appear to reduce the risk.[93] High consumption of soy-based foods may reduce risk.[94]
</p><h3>Pre-emptive surgery[edit]</h3><p>Removal of both breasts before any cancer has been diagnosed or any suspicious lump or other lesion has appeared (a procedure known as ""prophylactic bilateral mastectomy"" or ""risk reducing mastectomy"") may be considered in people with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which are associated with a substantially heightened risk for an eventual diagnosis of breast cancer.[95][96] Evidence is not strong enough to support this procedure in anyone but those at the highest risk.[97] BRCA testing is recommended in those with a high family risk after genetic counseling. It is not recommended routinely.[98]  This is because there are many forms of changes in BRCA genes, ranging from harmless polymorphisms to obviously dangerous frameshift mutations.[99]The effect of most of the identifiable changes in the genes is uncertain. Testing in an average-risk person is particularly likely to return one of these indeterminate, useless results. Removing the second breast in a person who has breast cancer (contralateral risk‐reducing mastectomy or CRRM) may reduce the risk of cancer in the second breast, however, it is unclear if removing the second breast in those who have breast cancer improves survival.[97]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>The selective estrogen receptor modulators (such as tamoxifen) reduce the risk of breast cancer but increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial cancer.[100] There is no overall change in the risk of death.[100][101] They are thus not recommended for the prevention of breast cancer in women at average risk but may be offered for those at high risk.[102] The benefit of breast cancer reduction continues for at least five years after stopping a course of treatment with these medications.[103]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Breast cancer management</div><p>The management of breast cancer depends on various factors, including the stage of the cancer and the person's age. Treatments are more aggressive when the cancer is more advanced or there is a higher risk of recurrence of the cancer following treatment.
</p><p>Breast cancer is usually treated with surgery, which may be followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both. A multidisciplinary approach is preferable.[114] Hormone receptor-positive cancers are often treated with hormone-blocking therapy over courses of several years. Monoclonal antibodies, or other immune-modulating treatments, may be administered in certain cases of metastatic and other advanced stages of breast cancer. Although this range of treatment is still being studied.[115]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><div> Chest after right breast mastectomy</div><p>Surgery involves the physical removal of the tumor, typically along with some of the surrounding tissue. One or more lymph nodes may be biopsied during the surgery; increasingly the lymph node sampling is performed by a sentinel lymph node biopsy.
</p><p>Standard surgeries include:
</p><ul>Mastectomy: Removal of the whole breast.
Quadrantectomy: Removal of one-quarter of the breast.
Lumpectomy: Removal of a small part of the breast.</ul><p>Once the tumor has been removed, if the person desires, breast reconstruction surgery, a type of plastic surgery, may then be performed to improve the aesthetic appearance of the treated site.
Alternatively, women use breast prostheses to simulate a breast under clothing, or choose a flat chest. Nipple prosthesis can be used at any time following the mastectomy.
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>Medications used after and in addition to surgery are called adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy or other types of therapy prior to surgery are called neoadjuvant therapy. Aspirin may reduce mortality from breast cancer when used with other treatments.[116][117]
</p><p>There are currently three main groups of medications used for adjuvant breast cancer treatment:  hormone-blocking agents, chemotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies.
</p><p>Hormone blocking therapy
</p><dl>Some breast cancers require estrogen to continue growing. They can be identified by the presence of estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) on their surface (sometimes referred to together as hormone receptors). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that either block the receptors, e.g. tamoxifen, or alternatively block the production of estrogen with an aromatase inhibitor, e.g. anastrozole[118] or letrozole. The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years.[119] Letrozole is recommended for 5 years.  Aromatase inhibitors are only suitable for women after menopause; however, in this group, they appear better than tamoxifen.[120] This is because the active aromatase in postmenopausal women is different from the prevalent form in premenopausal women, and therefore these agents are ineffective in inhibiting the predominant aromatase of premenopausal women.[121] Aromatase inhibitors should not be given to premenopausal women with intact ovarian function (unless they are also on treatment to stop their ovaries from working).[122] CDK inhibitors can be used in combination with endocrine or aromatase therapy.[123]</dl><p>Chemotherapy
</p><dl>Chemotherapy is predominantly used for cases of breast cancer in stages 2–4, and is particularly beneficial in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease. The chemotherapy medications are administered in combinations, usually for periods of 3–6 months. One of the most common regimens, known as ""AC"",  combines cyclophosphamide with doxorubicin. Sometimes a taxane drug, such as docetaxel, is added, and the regime is then known as ""CAT"". Another common treatment is cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (or ""CMF""). Most chemotherapy medications work by destroying fast-growing and/or fast-replicating cancer cells, either by causing DNA damage upon replication or by other mechanisms. However, the medications also damage fast-growing normal cells, which may cause serious side effects. Damage to the heart muscle is the most dangerous complication of doxorubicin, for example.</dl><p>Monoclonal antibodies
</p><dl>Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody to HER2, has improved the 5-year disease free survival of stage 1–3 HER2-positive breast cancers to about 87% (overall survival 95%).[124] Between 25% and 30% of breast cancers overexpress the HER2 gene or its protein product,[125] and overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer is associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. Trastuzumab, however, is very expensive, and its use may cause serious side effects (approximately 2% of people who receive it develop significant heart damage).[126] Another antibody pertuzumab prevents HER2 dimerization and is recommended together with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in severe disease.[127] [128]</dl><h3>Radiation[edit]</h3><div> Internal radiotherapy for breast cancer</div><p>Radiotherapy is given after surgery to the region of the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes, to destroy microscopic tumor cells that may have escaped surgery. It may also have a beneficial effect on tumor microenvironment.[129][130] Radiation therapy can be delivered as external beam radiotherapy or as brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy). Conventionally radiotherapy is given after the operation for breast cancer.  Radiation can also be given at the time of operation on the breast cancer. Radiation can reduce the risk of recurrence by 50–66% (1/2 – 2/3 reduction of risk) when delivered in the correct dose[131] and is considered essential when breast cancer is treated by removing only the lump (Lumpectomy or Wide local excision).
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Treatments are being evaluated in trials. This includes individual drugs, combinations of drugs, and surgical and radiation techniques  Investigations include new types of targeted therapy,[188] cancer vaccines, oncolytic virotherapy,[189] gene therapy[190][191] and immunotherapy.[192]
</p><p>The latest research is reported annually at scientific meetings such as that of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium,[193] and the St. Gallen Oncology Conference in St. Gallen, Switzerland.[194] These studies are reviewed by professional societies and other organizations, and formulated into guidelines for specific treatment groups and risk category.
</p><p>Fenretinide, a retinoid, is also being studied as a way to reduce the risk of breast cancer (retinoids are medications related to vitamin A).[195][196]
</p><h3>Cryoablation[edit]</h3><p>As of 2014 cryoablation is being studied to see if it could be a substitute for a lumpectomy in small cancers.[197] There is tentative evidence in those with tumors less than 2 centimeters.[198] It may also be used in those in who surgery is not possible.[198] Another review states that cryoablation looks promising for early breast cancer of small size.[199]
</p><h3>Breast cancer cell lines[edit]</h3><div>See also: List of breast cancer cell lines</div><p>A considerable part of the current knowledge on breast carcinomas is based on in vivo and in vitro studies performed with cell lines derived from breast cancers. These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating stromal cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard media. The first breast cancer cell line described, BT-20, was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumors, mainly from pleural effusions. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumor cells with little or no contamination by fibroblasts and other tumor stroma cells.
Many of the currently used BCC lines were established in the late 1970s. A very few of them, namely MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231, account for more than two-thirds of all abstracts reporting studies on mentioned breast cancer cell lines, as concluded from a Medline-based survey.
</p><h3>Molecular markers[edit]</h3><h4>Transcription factors[edit]</h4><p>NFAT transcription factors are implicated in breast cancer, more specifically in the process of cell motility at the basis of metastasis formation. Indeed, NFAT1 (NFATC2) and NFAT5 are pro-invasive and pro-migratory in breast carcinoma[200][201]  and NFAT3 (NFATc4) is an inhibitor of cell motility.[202]
NFAT1 regulates the expression of the TWEAKR and its ligand TWEAK with the Lipocalin 2 to increase breast cancer cell invasion[203] and NFAT3 inhibits Lipocalin 2 expression to blunt the cell invasion.[202]
</p><h4>Metabolic markers[edit]</h4><p>Clinically, the most useful metabolic markers in breast cancer are the estrogen and progesterone receptors that are used to predict response to hormone therapy. New or potentially new markers for breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2[204] to identify people at high risk of developing breast cancer, HER-2,[medical citation needed] and SCD1, for predicting response to therapeutic regimens, and urokinase plasminogen activator, PA1-1 and SCD1 for assessing prognosis.[medical citation needed]
</p>"
94,malignant neoplasm of lung,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatment of adenocarcinoma of the lung depends on several factors including stage, resectability, performance status, histology and genomic alterations acquired by the individual tumor.[24] As in most cancer types, treatment approaches can be broadly divided into 5 categories: surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>
Early stage (I, II and IIIA) lung adenocarcinomas are typically treated surgically to remove the tumor with pneumonectomy or lobectomy, if it is found to be resectable with imaging studies and biopsies and if the patient is considered able to tolerate surgery.[10] Video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) is often adopted, which consists in the insertion of a thorascope inside a small incision made in the chest; a lobe can be removed via the scope through this small incision.[24] </p><div> Incidence of adenocarcinoma of the lung (in yellow) as compared to other lung cancer types, with fractions of non-smokers versus smokers shown for each type.[25]</div><h3>Chemotherapy[edit]</h3><p>For advanced (stage IV) and unresectable lung tumors, the first-line therapy is platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, combining cisplatin or carboplatin with another cytotoxic agent.[3] Regimens strongly depend on each patient performance status and response, and when the risk of adverse events could worsen quality of life significantly, basic supportive care is more recommended. Chemotherapy is also used as an adjuvant therapy following surgery to kill remaining cancer cells in patients with stage IIA, IIB and IIIA NSCLC.[24]
</p><h3>Radiotherapy[edit]</h3><p>Adenocarcinoma is a non-small cell lung carcinoma, and it is not as responsive to radiation therapy compared to small cell lung carcinoma.[10] However, radiotherapy may be used as an adjuvant therapy for patients who have undergone a resection surgery to reduce the risk of lung cancer relapse. It may also benefit inoperable tumors that are localized to the chest and be part of palliative care to improve quality of life in patients not responding to surgery or chemotherapy.[24]
</p><h3>Targeted therapy[edit]</h3><p>Targeted therapy is available for lung adenocarcinomas with certain molecular characteristics. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to target mutant components of the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1, which show frequent alterations in lung adenocarcinomas.
</p><p>First-generation EGFR TKIs, including gefitinib and erlotinib, have been shown to be more effective in treating EGFR-mutated patients with respect to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Second-generation inhibitors such as afatinib and dacomitinib provided a broader scope of application as they are able to target not only EGFR but also other genes of its same family, such as HER2 and HER4 (also known as ERBB2 and ERBB4), and they have shown improved progression-free survival compared to gefitinib. As the most common cause of acquired resistance to first-generation TKIs is a second EGFR mutation on codon 790, a third-generation EGFR TKI, osimertinib, has been developed to target this new mutation as well.[3] MET amplification is another known mechanism of acquired resistance.[2]
</p><p>ALK inhibitors such as crizotinib showed to be effective against tumors harboring ALK fusions. Most patients previously treated with crizotinib benefited from second-generation ALK inhibitors including ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib. Resistance to ALK inhibitors can occur with novel acquired ALK mutations or amplifications.[3]
</p><p>Also ROS1-positive tumors have shown high sensitivity to ALK inhibitors due to the high homology between the kinase domains of ROS1 and ALK.[3]
</p><h3>Immunotherapy[edit]</h3><p>Immune response can be prevented via activation of immune checkpoints, which consist in the binding of a ligand protein (e.g. PD-L1) to a receptor (e.g. PD-1) on the immune cell surface. As a consequence, cancer cells expressing PD-L1 can inactivate T cells thus fostering tumor growth. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been developed to restore T cell-mediated antitumor immunity by blocking either the ligand or the receptor.
</p><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for NSCLC, including anti-PD-1 nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Anti-PD-1 agents are used for patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors progress after first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab was established as a new standard of care for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression levels, and responses are even more pronounced for tumor with a high mutational burden (i.e. having an elevated number of mutations).[3]
</p><p>Therapeutic approaches combining multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors or one immune checkpoint inhibitors and a cytotoxic agent are undergoing clinical trials as of 2018.[3][26] The potential role of anti-PD-1 agents as neoadjuvant therapy in resectable NSCLCs is also being investigated.[27]

95,malignant neoplasm of prostate,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Diet and lifestyle[edit]</h3><p>The data on the relationship between diet and prostate cancer is poor.[84] In light of this, the rate of prostate cancer is linked to the consumption of the Western diet.[84] There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat, and carbohydrate intake and risk of prostate cancer.[84][85] Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing prostate cancer does not suggest that they reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although additional research is needed.[84][86] Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk.[16][84] High calcium intake has been linked to advanced prostate cancer.[87]
</p><p>Consuming fish may lower prostate-cancer deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence.[88] Some evidence supports lower rates of prostate cancer with a vegetarian diet.[89] There is some tentative evidence for foods containing lycopene and selenium.[90][91] Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, soy, beans and other legumes may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, especially more advanced cancers.[92]
</p><p>Men who get regular exercise may have a slightly lower risk, especially vigorous activity and the risk of advanced prostate cancer.[92]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>In those who are being regularly screened, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) reduce the overall risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer, but there are insufficient data to determine if they have an effect on the risk of death and they may increase the chance of more serious cases.[93]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of prostate cancer</div><p>The first decision to be made in managing prostate cancer is whether treatment is needed. Prostate cancer, especially low-grade forms found in elderly men, often grows so slowly that no treatment is required.[102] Treatment may also be inappropriate if a person has other serious health problems or is not expected to live long enough for symptoms to appear. Alternative approaches that delay active treatment and instead involve surveillance of diagnosed prostate cancers are termed expectant management.[102] Expectant management is divided into two approaches: Watchful Waiting, which has palliative intent, and Active Surveillance, which has curative intent.[102]
</p><p>Which option is best depends on the stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are age, general health, and a person's views about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because most treatments can have significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations. A combination of the treatment options is often recommended for managing prostate cancer.[103][104][105]
</p><p>Guidelines for treatment for specific clinical situations requires a good estimation of a person's long-term life expectancy.[106] People can also use an 18-item questionnaire to learn whether they have good knowledge and understanding about their treatment options before they choose. Most of those who are newly diagnosed and made a treatment choice can not correctly answer over half of the questions.[106] Radiotherapy and surgery appear to result in similar outcomes with respect to bowel, erectile and urinary function after five years.[107]
</p><p>If radiation therapy is done first, and fails, then radical prostatectomy may be an option though it becomes a very technically challenging surgery, is associated with decreased quality of life and may not be feasible.[108] On the other hand, radiation therapy done after surgical failure may have many complications.[109] It is associated with a small increase in bladder and colon cancer.[110]
</p><p>In localized disease, it is unknown if radical prostatectomy is better or worse than watchful waiting.[111]
</p><p>A meta-analysis on the effects of voiding position during urination in males with prostate enlargement showed that sitting was superior to standing. Bladder emptying was significantly improved, while there was a trend towards a higher urinary flow and shorter voiding time.[112]
</p><h3>Surveillance[edit]</h3><p>Many men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer are eligible for active surveillance. This means that careful observation of the tumor is conducted over time, with the intention of initiating treatment if there are signs of cancer progression. Active surveillance is not synonymous with watchful waiting, an older term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that palliative, not curative, treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.[102]
</p><p>Active surveillance involves monitoring the tumor for signs of growth or the appearance of symptoms. The monitoring process may involve serial PSA tests, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies. The goal of surveillance is to avoid overtreatment and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor (that in most people, would be unlikely to cause problems). This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause anxiety for people who wrongly believe that all cancer is deadly or themselves to have life-threatening cancer. For 50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies from other causes.[113]
</p><h3>Aggressive cancer[edit]</h3><p>Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer can be difficult.[114] Treatment of aggressive prostate cancers may involve surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy), external beam radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), chemotherapy, oral chemotherapeutic drugs (temozolomide/TMZ), cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, or some combination.[115][116]
</p><p>Although the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the US has resulted in diagnosis at earlier age and cancer stage, the vast majority of cases are still diagnosed in men older than 65 years, and approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in men older than 75 years.[117] Though US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend using life expectancy greater than or less than 10 years to help make treatment decisions, in practice, many elderly patients are not offered curative treatment options such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and are instead treated with hormonal therapy or watchful waiting.[118] This pattern can be attributed to factors such as medical co-morbidity and patient preferences is regard to quality of life in addition to prostate cancer specific risk factors such as pretreatment PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage. As the average life expectancy increases due to advances in the treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other chronic diseases, it is likely that more elderly patients will be living long enough to suffer the consequences of their prostate cancer. Therefore, there is currently much interest in the role of aggressive prostate cancer treatment modalities such as with surgery or radiation in the elderly population who have localized disease.
</p><p>If the cancer has spread beyond the prostate, treatment options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer use a variety of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, HIFU, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. There are exceptions: local or metastasis-directed therapy by radiation treatment may be used for advanced tumors with a limited amount of metastases,[119] and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.
</p><p>Sipuleucel-T, a cancer vaccine has been found to result in a benefit (a four-month increase in survival) for men with metastatic prostate cancer.[120]
</p><h3>Castration-resistant[edit]</h3><p>Most hormone dependent cancers become resistant to treatment after one to three years and resume growth despite hormone therapy. Previously considered ""hormone-refractory prostate cancer"" or ""androgen-independent prostate cancer"", the term castration-resistant has replaced ""hormone refractory"" because while they are no longer responsive to castration treatment (reduction of available androgen/testosterone/DHT by chemical or surgical means), these cancers still show reliance upon hormones for androgen receptor activation.[121]
</p><p>The cancer chemotherapic docetaxel has been used as treatment for CRPC with a median survival benefit of 2 to 3 months.[122][123] A second-line chemotherapy treatment is cabazitaxel.[124] A combination of bevacizumab, docetaxel, thalidomide and prednisone appears effective in the treatment of CRPC.[125]
</p><p>The immunotherapy treatment with sipuleucel-T in CRPC increases survival by 4 months.[126] The second line hormonal therapy abiraterone increases survival by 4.6 months when compared to placebo.[127] Enzalutamide is another second line hormonal agent with a 5-month survival advantage over placebo. Both abiraterone and enzalutamide are currently being tested in clinical trials in those with CRPC who have not previously received chemotherapy.[128][129]
</p><p>Only a subset of people respond to androgen signaling blocking drugs and certain cells with characteristics resembling stem cells remain unaffected.[130][131] Therefore, the desire to improve outcome of people with CRPC has resulted in the claims of increasing doses further or combination therapy with synergistic androgen signaling blocking agents.[132] But even these combination will not affect stem-like cells that do not exhibit androgen signaling. It is possible that for further advances, a combination of androgen signaling blocking agent with stem-like cell directed differentiation therapy drug would prove ideal.[133]
</p><h3>Palliative care[edit]</h3><p>Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer can be difficult.[114] Treatment of aggressive prostate cancers may involve surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy), external beam radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), chemotherapy, oral chemotherapeutic drugs (temozolomide/TMZ), cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, or some combination.[115][116]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><div>For the journal, see Prostate Cancer (journal).</div><h3>CRPC[edit]</h3><p>MDV3100 was in phase III trials for CRPC (chemo-naive and post-chemo patient populations)[185] and gained FDA approval in 2012 as enzalutamide for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.[128][129]
</p><p>Alpharadin completed a phase 3 trial for CRPC patients with bone metastasis. A pre-planned interim analysis showed improved survival and quality of life. The study was stopped for ethical reasons to give the placebo group the same treatment. Alpharadin uses bone targeted Radium-223 isotopes to kill cancer cells by alpha radiation.[186][unreliable medical source?] It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May, 15, 2013, ahead of schedule under the priority review program.[187] Alpharadin still waits for approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
</p><p>As of 2016[update] PARP inhibitor olaparib has shown promise in clinical trials for CRPC.[188] Also in trials for CRPC are : checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab, CYP17 inhibitor galeterone (TOK-001), and immunotherapy PROSTVAC.[188]
</p><p>All medications for CRPC block AR signaling via direct or indirect targeting of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD). Over the last decade molecules that could successfully target these alternative domains have emerged.[189] Such therapies could provide an advantage; particularly in treating prostate cancers that are resistant to current therapies like enzalutamide.[189]
</p><h3>Pre-clinical[edit]</h3><p>Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase has been identified as playing a significant role in the survival of prostate cancer cells.[190][191][192] Medications which target this enzyme may be an effective therapy for limiting tumor growth and cancer metastasis as well as inducing programmed cell death in cancer cells.[190][191][192] In particular, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors produce massive, rapid programmed cell death in prostate cancer cells.[190][191][192]
</p><p>Several medications that target alternative domains on the androgen receptor (DNA binding domain - DBD, and transactivation domain - TAD) or degrade cellular AR protein have reached clinical trials, while some are in pre-clinical development.[189] These therapies hold promis in treating AR dependent prostate cancers both in early and late stage, because many have shown the ability to target both the full-length and the splice-variant forms of the androgen receptor.[189]
</p><h3>Cancer models[edit]</h3><p>Scientists have established a few prostate cancer cell lines to investigate the mechanism involved in the progression of prostate cancer. LNCaP, PC-3 (PC3), and DU-145 (DU145) are commonly used prostate cancer cell lines. The LNCaP cancer cell line was established from a human lymph node metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were established from human prostatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to bone and to brain, respectively. LNCaP cells express androgen receptor (AR), but PC-3 and DU-145 cells express very little or no AR. AR, an androgen-activated transcription factor, belongs to the steroid nuclear receptor family. Development of the prostate is dependent on androgen signaling mediated through AR, and AR is also important during the development of prostate cancer.
</p><p>The proliferation of LNCaP cells is androgen-dependent but the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells is androgen-insensitive. Elevation of AR expression is often observed in advanced prostate tumors in patients.[193][194] Some androgen-independent LNCaP sublines have been developed from the ATCC androgen-dependent LNCaP cells after androgen deprivation for study of prostate cancer progression. These androgen-independent LNCaP cells have elevated AR expression and express prostate specific antigen upon androgen treatment. The paradox is that androgens inhibit the proliferation of these androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.[195][196][197]
</p><h3>Infections[edit]</h3><p>In 2006, a previously unknown retrovirus, Xenotropic MuLV-related virus (XMRV), was associated with human prostate tumors,[198] but subsequent reports on the virus were contradictory,[199][200] and the original 2006 finding was instead due to a previously undetected contamination.[201] The journals Science and PlosONE both retracted XMRV related articles.[202][203]
</p><h3>Diagnosis[edit]</h3><p>At present, an active area of research and non-clinically applied investigations involve non-invasive methods of prostate tumor detection.  A molecular test that detects the presence of cell-associated PCA3 mRNA in fluid obtained from the prostate and first-void urine sample has also been under investigation. PCA3 mRNA is expressed almost exclusively by prostate cells and has been shown to be highly over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. The test result is currently reported as a specimen ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA.
</p><p>Although not a replacement for serum PSA level, the PCA3 test is an additional tool to help decide whether, in men suspected of having prostate cancer (especially if an initial biopsy fails to explain the elevated serum PSA), a biopsy/rebiopsy is really needed. The higher the expression of PCA3 in the sample, the greater the likelihood of a positive biopsy; i.e., the presence of cancer cells in the prostate.[204]

96,malignant neoplasms,"<h2>What Are the Treatments for Cancer?</h2><p>Depending on the type and stage of cancer, treatments to eradicate the tumor or slow its growth may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy or immunotherapy. </p>"
97,malignant tumor of colon,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>It has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors, and about a quarter of all cases are preventable.[75] Increasing surveillance, engaging in physical activity, consuming a diet high in fiber, and reducing smoking and alcohol consumption decrease the risk.[76][77]
</p><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><p>Lifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and obesity.[78][79] The risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet.[80]
</p><p>Starting in the 1970s, dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats. This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies. However, large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions (outside of eating a healthy diet) will have significant protective effects.[81]:432–433[82]:125–126 In 2018 the National Cancer Institute stated that ""There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree.""[78][83]
</p><p>With regard to dietary fiber, the 2014 World Health Organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer, but most studies have not borne this out, and status of the science remained unclear as of 2014.[82] A 2019 review however found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains.[84] The World Cancer Research Fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as ""probable"" as of 2017.[85]
</p><p>Higher physical activity is recommended.[20][86] Physical exercise is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk.[87][88] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of colon cancer by about 21%.[89] Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from colon cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.[90]
</p><h3>Medication and supplements[edit]</h3><p>Aspirin and celecoxib appear to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in those at high risk.[91][92] Aspirin is recommended in those who are 50 to 60 years old, do not have an increased risk of bleeding, and are at risk for cardiovascular disease to prevent colorectal cancer.[93] It is not recommended in those at average risk.[94]
</p><p>There is tentative evidence for calcium supplementation, but it is not sufficient to make a recommendation.[95] Vitamin D intake and blood levels are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer.[96][97]
</p><h3>Screening[edit]</h3><p>As more than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and for prevention.[19][98] Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2–3 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms.[19] Any polyps that are detected can be removed, usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and thus prevent them from turning into cancer. Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.[99]
</p><p>The three main screening tests are colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42% of cancers are found.[100] Flexible sigmoidoscopy, however, has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause.[101]
</p><p>Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) of the stool is typically recommended every two years and can be either guaiac-based or immunochemical.[19] If abnormal FOBT results are found, participants are typically referred for a follow-up colonoscopy examination. Yearly to every two year FOBT screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths by 16% and among those participating in screening colorectal cancer deaths can be reduced up to 23%, although it has not been proven to reduce all-cause mortality.[102] Immunochemical tests are accurate and do not require dietary or medication changes before testing.[103]
</p><p>Other options include virtual colonoscopy and stool DNA screening testing (FIT-DNA). Virtual colonoscopy via a CT scan appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive, associated with radiation exposure, and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths like standard colonoscopy can.[19] Stool DNA screening test looks for biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions, including altered DNA and blood hemoglobin. A positive result should be followed by colonoscopy. FIT-DNA has more false positives than FIT and thus results in more adverse effects.[5] Further study is required as of 2016 to determine if a three-year screening interval is correct.[5]
</p><h4>Recommendations[edit]</h4><p>In the United States, screening is typically recommended between ages 50 to 75 years.[5] The American Cancer Society recommends starting at the age of 45.[104] For those between 76 and 85 years old, the decision to screen should be individualized.[5] Several screening methods can be used, including stool based tests every 3 years, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years and colonoscopy every 10 years. For those at high risk, screenings usually begin at around 40.[19][105] It is unclear which of these two methods is better.[106] Colonoscopy may find more cancers in the first part of the colon, but is associated with greater cost and more complications.[106] For people with average risk who have had a high-quality colonoscopy with normal results, the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend any type of screening in the 10 years following the colonoscopy.[107][108] For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, screening is not recommended.[109] It takes about 10 years after screening for one out of a 1000 people to benefit.[110] The USPSTF list seven potential strategies for screening, with the most important thing being that at least one of these strategies is appropriately used.[5]
</p><p>In Canada, among those 50 to 75 years old at normal risk, fecal immunochemical testing or FOBT is recommended every two years or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years.[111] Colonoscopy is less preferred.[111]
</p><p>Some countries have national colorectal screening programs which offer FOBT screening for all adults within a certain age group, typically starting between ages 50 to 60. Examples of countries with organised screening include the United Kingdom,[112] Australia,[113] and the Netherlands.[114]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatment of colorectal cancer can be aimed at cure or palliation. The decision on which aim to adopt depends on various factors, including the person's health and preferences, as well as the stage of the tumor.[115] When colorectal cancer is caught early, surgery can be curative. However, when it is detected at later stages (for which metastases are present), this is less likely and treatment is often directed at palliation, to relieve symptoms caused by the tumour and keep the person as comfortable as possible.[19]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><div> A diagram of a local resection of early stage colon cancer</div><div> A diagram of local surgery for rectal cancer</div><p>If the cancer is found at a very early stage, it may be removed during a colonoscopy.[6] For people with localized cancer, the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins, with the attempt of achieving a cure. This can either be done by an open laparotomy or sometimes laparoscopically.[19] The colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a colostomy.[6]
</p><p>If there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs they may also be removed. Sometimes chemotherapy is used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it. The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs.[19]
</p><h3>Chemotherapy[edit]</h3><p>In both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.
</p><p>In Stage I colon cancer, no chemotherapy is offered, and surgery is the definitive treatment. The role of chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer is debatable, and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as T4 tumor, undifferentiated tumor, vascular and perineural invasion or inadequate lymph node sampling is identified.[116] It is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy. For stage III and Stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment.[19]
</p><p>If cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which is the case with stage III and stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding chemotherapy agents fluorouracil, capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy. If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial. If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative. Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used.[19] Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT.[117] The drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication while fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine. Some specific regimens used for CRC are CAPOX, FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI.[118] Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy. Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the two FDA approved ones are cetuximab and panitumumab.[119]
</p><p>The primary difference in the approach to low stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy. Often, it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection, so that ultimately as colostomy is not required. However, it may not be possible in low lying tumors, in which case, a permanent colostomy may be required. Stage IV rectal cancer is treated similar to stage IV colon cancer.
</p><h3>Radiation therapy[edit]</h3><p>While a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer,[19] its use in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation.[120] Just as for chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting for some stages of rectal cancer. For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment.[121]
</p><h3>Immunotherapy[edit]</h3><p>Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been found to be useful for a type of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability.[122][123] Pembrolizumab is approved for advanced CRC tumours that are MMR deficient and have failed usual treatments.[124] Most people who do improve, however, still worsen after months or years.[123] Other types of colorectal cancer as of 2017 is still being studied.[122][123]
</p><h3>Palliative care[edit]</h3><p>Palliative care is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms.[125][126]
</p><p>Involvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family, by improving symptoms, anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital.[127]
</p><p>In people with incurable colorectal cancer, palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer, thereby improving quality of life. Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement. These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.[128] Non-operative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications.[129]
</p><h3>Follow-up[edit]</h3><p>The aims of follow-up are to diagnose, in the earliest possible stage, any metastasis or tumors that develop later, but did not originate from the original cancer (metachronous lesions).
</p><p>The U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer.[130][131] A medical history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years. Carcinoembryonic antigen blood level measurements follow the same timing, but are only advised for people with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention. A CT-scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure). A colonoscopy can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months. If a villous polyp, a polyp >1 centimeter or high grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years. For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.
</p><p>Routine PET or ultrasound scanning, chest X-rays, complete blood count or liver function tests are not recommended.[130][131] A 2016 systematic review concluded that more intense surveillance and close follow-up does not provide additional survival benefits in non-metastatic colorectal cancers.[132]
</p><h3>Exercise[edit]</h3><p>Exercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy to cancer survivors. In epidemiological studies, exercise may decrease colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting. These differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and expression of biomarkers. Patients with tumors that lacked CTNNB1 expression (β-catenin), involved in Wnt signalling pathway, required more than 18 Metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week, a measure of exercise, to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. The mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways. In clinical studies, a pro-inflammatory response was found in patients with stage II-III colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy. Oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for benefits observed. A significant decrease in 8-oxo-dG was found in the urine of patients who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy. Other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormone and sex-steroid hormones, although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers[133][134]
</p><p>Another potential biomarker may be p27. Survivors with tumors that expressed p27 and performed greater and equal to 18 MET hours per week were found to have reduced colorectal-cancer mortality survival compared to those with less than 18 MET hours per week. Survivors without p27 expression who exercised were shown to have worse outcomes. The constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may explain the loss of p27 and excess energy balance may up-regulate p27 to stop cancer cells from dividing.[134]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Preliminary in-vitro evidence suggests lactic acid bacteria (e.g., lactobacilli, streptococci or lactococci) may be protective against the development and progression of colorectal cancer through several mechanisms such as antioxidant activity, immunomodulation, promoting programmed cell death, antiproliferative effects, and epigenetic modification of cancer cells.[147]

99,manic disorder,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>Attempts at prevention of bipolar disorder have focused on stress (such as childhood adversity or highly conflictual families) which, although not a diagnostically specific causal agent for bipolar, does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness.[107] There has been debate regarding the causal relationship between usage of cannabis and bipolar disorder.[108]
</p><h2>Management</h2><div>Main article: Treatment of bipolar disorder</div><p>There are a number of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic techniques used to treat bipolar disorder. Individuals may use self-help and pursue recovery.
</p><p>Hospitalization may be required especially with the manic episodes present in bipolar I. This can be voluntary or (local legislation permitting) involuntary (called civil or involuntary commitment). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to deinstitutionalization, although these can still occur.[109] Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or an Assertive Community Treatment team, supported employment and patient-led support groups, intensive outpatient programs. These are sometimes referred to as partial-inpatient programs.[110]
</p><h3>Psychosocial</h3><p>Psychotherapy is aimed at alleviating core symptoms, recognizing episode triggers, reducing negative expressed emotion in relationships, recognizing prodromal symptoms before full-blown recurrence, and, practicing the factors that lead to maintenance of remission.[111][112][113] Cognitive behavioral therapy, family-focused therapy, and psychoeducation have the most evidence for efficacy in regard to relapse prevention, while interpersonal and social rhythm therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy appear the most effective in regard to residual depressive symptoms. Most studies have been based only on bipolar I, however, and treatment during the acute phase can be a particular challenge.[114] Some clinicians emphasize the need to talk with individuals experiencing mania, to develop a therapeutic alliance in support of recovery.[115]
</p><h3>Medication</h3><div> Lithium is often used to treat bipolar disorder and has the best evidence for reducing suicide.</div><p>A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder.[59] The medication with the best evidence is lithium, which is an effective treatment for acute manic episodes, preventing relapses, and bipolar depression.[116] Lithium reduces the risk of suicide, self-harm, and death in people with bipolar disorder.[117] It is unclear if ketamine (a common general anaesthetic used in surgery) is useful in bipolar as of 2015[update].[118]
</p><h4>Mood stabilizers</h4><p>Lithium and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproic acid are used as mood stabilizers to treat bipolar disorder. These mood stabilizers are used for long-term mood stabilization but have not demonstrated the ability to quickly treat acute bipolar depression.[119] Lithium is preferred for long-term mood stabilization.[59] Carbamazepine effectively treats manic episodes, with some evidence it has greater benefit in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, or those with more psychotic symptoms or a more schizoaffective clinical picture. It is less effective in preventing relapse than lithium or valproate.[120][121] Valproate has become a commonly prescribed treatment and effectively treats manic episodes.[122] Lamotrigine has some efficacy in treating bipolar depression, and this benefit is greatest in more severe depression.[123] It has also been shown to have some benefit in preventing bipolar disorder relapses, though there are concerns about the studies done, and is of no benefit in rapid cycling subtype of bipolar disorder.[124] The effectiveness of topiramate is unknown.[125]
</p><h4>Antipsychotics</h4><p>Antipsychotic medications are effective for short-term treatment of bipolar manic episodes and appear to be superior to lithium and anticonvulsants for this purpose.[59] Atypical antipsychotics are also indicated for bipolar depression refractory to treatment with mood stabilizers.[119] Olanzapine is effective in preventing relapses, although the supporting evidence is weaker than the evidence for lithium.[126]
</p><h4>Antidepressants</h4><p>Antidepressants are not recommended for use alone in the treatment of bipolar disorder and have not been found to be of any benefit over that found with mood stabilizers.[11][127] Atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., aripiprazole) are preferred over antidepressants to augment the effects of mood stabilizers due to the lack of efficacy of antidepressants in bipolar disorder.[119]
</p><h4>Other</h4><p>Short courses of benzodiazepines may be used in addition to other medications until mood stabilizing become effective.[128] Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective form of treatment for acute mood disturbances in those with bipolar disorder, especially when psychotic or catatonic features are displayed.[11] ECT is also recommended for use in pregnant women with bipolar disorder.[11]
</p><p>Contrary to widely held views, stimulants are relatively safe in bipolar disorder, and considerable evidence suggests they may even produce an antimanic effect. In cases of comorbid ADHD and bipolar, stimulants may help improve both conditions.[129]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine</h3><p>Several studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may have beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, but not manic symptoms. However, only a few small studies of variable quality have been published and there is not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions.[130][131]
</p>"
100,melanoma,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><h3>Avoiding ultraviolet radiation[edit]</h3><p>Minimizing exposure to sources of ultraviolet radiation (the sun and sunbeds),[69] following sun protection measures and wearing sun protective clothing (long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, and broad-brimmed hats) can offer protection.
</p><p>Using artificial light for tanning was once believed to help prevent skin cancers, but it can actually lead to an increased incidence of melanomas.[70]
</p><p>UV nail lamps, which are used in nail salons to dry nail polish, are another common and widespread source of UV radiation that could be avoided.[71][72] Although the risk of developing skin cancer through UV nail lamp use is low, it is still recommended to wear fingerless gloves and/or apply SPF 30 or greater sunscreen to the hands before using a UV nail lamp.[71][72]
</p><p>The body uses UV light to generate vitamin D so there is a need to balance getting enough sunlight to maintain healthy vitamin D levels and reducing the risk of melanoma; it takes around a half hour of sunlight for the body to generate its vitamin D for the day and this is about the same amount of time it takes for fair-skinned people to get a sunburn. Exposure to sunlight can be intermittent instead of all at one time.[73]
</p><h3>Sunscreen[edit]</h3><p>Sunscreen appears to be effective in preventing melanoma.[2][74] In the past, use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of 50 or higher on exposed areas were recommended; as older sunscreens more effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF.[75] Currently, newer sunscreen ingredients (avobenzone, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide) effectively block both UVA and UVB even at lower SPFs. Sunscreen also protects against squamous cell carcinoma, another skin cancer.[76]
</p><p>Concerns have been raised that sunscreen might create a false sense of security against sun damage.[77]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>A 2005 review found tentative evidence that statin and fibrate medication may decrease the risk of melanoma.[78] A 2006 review however did not support any benefit.[79]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><div> Extensive malignant melanoma on a person's chest</div><p>Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is done with a skin biopsy. This is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the stage, a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be performed. Controversy exists around trial evidence for sentinel lymph node biopsy;[80] with unclear evidence of benefit as of 2015.[81] Treatment of advanced malignant melanoma is performed from a multidisciplinary approach.
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, but further surgery is often necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate surgical margins and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2–0.5 cm (0.1–0.2 in). Many surgeons consider 0.5 cm (0.2 in) the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ,[82] but 0.2 cm (0.1 in) margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery (Mohs surgery, or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades.[83] A 2009 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found a small difference in survival rates favoring wide excision of primary cutaneous melanomas, but these results were not statistically significant.[84]
</p><p>Mohs surgery has been reported with cure rate as low as 77%[85] and as high as 98.0% for melanoma-in-situ.[86] CCPDMA and the ""double scalpel"" peripheral margin controlled surgery is equivalent to Mohs surgery in effectiveness on this ""intra-epithelial"" type of melanoma.
</p><p>Melanomas that spread usually do so to the lymph nodes in the area of the tumor before spreading elsewhere. Attempts to improve survival by removing lymph nodes surgically (lymphadenectomy) were associated with many complications, but no overall survival benefit. Recently, the technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been developed to reduce the complications of lymph node surgery while allowing assessment of the involvement of nodes with tumor.[87]
</p><p>Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes is a widely used procedure when treating cutaneous melanoma.[88][89]
</p><p>Neither sentinel lymph node biopsy nor other diagnostic tests should be performed to evaluate early, thin melanoma, including melanoma in situ, T1a melanoma or T1b melanoma ≤ 0.5mm.[90] People with these conditions are unlikely to have the cancer spread to their lymph nodes or anywhere else and have a 5-year survival rate of 97%.[90] Because of these considerations, sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered unnecessary health care for them.[90] Furthermore, baseline blood tests and radiographic studies should not be performed only based on identifying this kind of melanoma, as there are more accurate tests for detecting cancer and these tests have high false-positive rates.[90] To potentially correct false positives, gene expression profiling may be used as auxiliary testing for ambiguous and small lesions.[91][92]
</p><p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often performed, especially for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs.[citation needed] A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunoperoxidase staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had a small number of positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.
</p><p>If a lymph node is positive, depending on the extent of lymph node spread, a radical lymph node dissection will often be performed. If the disease is completely resected, the patient will be considered for adjuvant therapy.
Excisional skin biopsy is the management of choice. Here, the suspect lesion is totally removed with an adequate (but minimal, usually 1 or 2 mm) ellipse of surrounding skin and tissue.[93] To avoid disruption of the local lymphatic drainage, the preferred surgical margin for the initial biopsy should be narrow (1 mm). The biopsy should include the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers of the skin. This enables the histopathologist to determine the thickness of the melanoma by microscopic examination. This is described by Breslow's thickness (measured in millimeters). However, for large lesions, such as suspected lentigo maligna, or for lesions in surgically difficult areas (face, toes, fingers, eyelids), a small punch biopsy in representative areas will give adequate information and will not disrupt the final staging or depth determination. In no circumstances should the initial biopsy include the final surgical margin (0.5 cm, 1.0 cm, or 2 cm), as a misdiagnosis can result in excessive scarring and morbidity from the procedure. A large initial excision will disrupt the local lymphatic drainage and can affect further lymphangiogram-directed lymphnode dissection. A small punch biopsy can be used at any time where for logistical and personal reasons a patient refuses more invasive excisional biopsy. Small punch biopsies are minimally invasive and heal quickly, usually without noticeable scarring.
</p><h3>Add on treatment[edit]</h3><p>High-risk melanomas may require adjuvant treatment, although attitudes to this vary in different countries. In the United States, most patients in otherwise good health will begin up to a year of high-dose interferon treatment, which has severe side effects, but may improve the patient's prognosis slightly.[94] However, the British Association of Dermatologists guidelines on melanoma state that interferon is not recommended as a standard adjuvant treatment for melanoma.[95] A 2013 meta-analysis suggested that the addition of interferon alpha increased disease-free and overall survival for people with AJCC TNM stage II-III cutaneous melanoma.[96] A 2011 meta-analysis showed that interferon could lengthen the time before a melanoma comes back but increased survival by only 3% at 5 years. The unpleasant side effects also greatly decrease quality of life.[97]
</p><p>In Europe, interferon is usually not used outside the scope of clinical trials.[98][99]
</p><p>Metastatic melanomas can be detected by X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, PET and PET/CTs, ultrasound, LDH testing and photoacoustic detection.[100]
</p><h3>Chemotherapy[edit]</h3><p>Chemotherapy drugs such as Dacarbazine have been the backbone of metastatic melanoma treatment since FDA approval in 1975 however, its efficacy in terms of survival has never been proven in an RCT.[101]
</p><p>In people with locally advanced cutaneous malignancies and sarcoma, isolated limb infusion (ILI) has been found to be a minimally invasive and well-tolerated procedure for delivering regional chemotherapy.[102][103]
</p><h3>Targeted therapy[edit]</h3><p>Melanoma cells have mutations that allow them to survive and grow indefinitely in the body.[101] Small-molecule targeted therapies work by blocking the genes involved in pathways for tumor proliferation and survival.[101] The main treatments are BRAF, C-Kit and NRAS inhibitors.[104] These inhibitors work to inhibit the downstream pathways involved in cell proliferation and tumour development due to specific gene mutations.[105] People can be treated with small-molecule targeted inhibitors if they are positive for the specific mutation.[101] BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib and a MEK inhibitor trametinib are the most effective, approved treatments for BRAF positive melanoma.[106][101] Melanoma tumors can develop resistance during therapy which can make therapy no longer effective, but combining the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors may create a fast and lasting melanoma therapy response.[107]
</p><p>A number of treatments improve survival over traditional chemotherapy.[101] Biochemotherapy (chemotherapy with cytokines IL-2 and IFN-α) combined with BRAF inhibitors improved survival for people with BRAF positive melanoma.[101] Biochemotherapy alone did not improve overall survival and had higher toxicity than chemotherapy.[101] Combining multiple chemotherapy agents (polychemotherapy) did not improve survival over monochemotherapy.[101]
</p><h3>Immunotherapy[edit]</h3><p>Immunotherapy is aimed at stimulating the person’s immune system against the tumor, by enhancing the body's own ability to recognize and kill cancer cells.[108]  The current approach to treating melanoma with immunotherapy includes three broad categories of treatments including cytokines, immune check point inhibitors, and adoptive cell transfer.[108] These treatment options are most often used in people with metastatic melanoma and significantly improves overall survival.[101] However, these treatments are often costly. For example, one immune check point inhibitor treatment, pembrolizumab, costs $10,000 to $12,000 USD for a single dose administered every 3 weeks.[109]
</p><p>Cytokine therapies used for melanoma include IFN-a and IL-2.[110] IL-2 (Proleukin) was the first new therapy approved (1990 Europe, 1992 USA) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 20 years.[citation needed] IL-2 may offer the possibility of a complete and long-lasting remission in this disease in a small percentage of people with melanoma.[111] Intralesional IL-2 for in-transit metastases has a high complete response rate ranging from 40 to 100%.[106] Similarly, IFN-a has shown only modest survival benefits and high toxicity, limiting its use as a stand alone therapy.[101][110]
</p><p>Immune check point inhibitors include anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (ipilimumab and tremelimumab), toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, CD40 agonists, anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab, pidilizumab, and nivolumab) and PD-L1 antibodies.[108][110] Evidence suggests that anti-PD-1 antibodies are more effective than anti-CTLA4 antibodies with less systemic toxicity.[101] A therapeutic approach that includes the combination of different therapies improves overall survival and progression-free survival compared to treatment with the separate immunotherapy drugs alone.[101]
</p><p>Ongoing research is looking at treatment by adoptive cell transfer.[112] Adoptive cell transfer refers to the application of pre-stimulated, modified T cells or dendritic cells and is presently used to minimize complications from graft-versus-host disease.[110][113]
</p><h3>Lentigo maligna[edit]</h3><p>Standard excision is still being done by most surgeons. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate is exceedingly high (up to 50%). This is due to the ill-defined visible surgical margin, and the facial location of the lesions (often forcing the surgeon to use a narrow surgical margin). The narrow surgical margin used, combined with the limitation of the standard ""bread-loafing"" technique of fixed tissue histology – result in a high ""false negative"" error rate, and frequent recurrences. Margin control (peripheral margins) is necessary to eliminate the false negative errors. If bread loafing is used, distances from sections should approach 0.1 mm to assure that the method approaches complete margin control. A meta-analysis of the literature in 2014 found no randomized controlled trials of surgical interventions to treat lentigo maligna or melanoma in-situ, even though surgery is the most widely used treatment.[114]
</p><p>Mohs surgery has been done with cure rate reported to be as low as 77%,[85] and as high as 95% by another author.[86] The ""double scalpel"" peripheral margin controlled excision method approximates the Mohs method in margin control, but requires a pathologist intimately familiar with the complexity of managing the vertical margin on the thin peripheral sections and staining methods.[115]
</p><p>Some melanocytic nevi, and melanoma-in-situ (lentigo maligna) have resolved with an experimental treatment, imiquimod (Aldara) topical cream, an immune enhancing agent. Some dermasurgeons are combining the 2 methods: surgically excising the cancer and then treating the area with Aldara cream postoperatively for three months. While some studies have suggested the adjuvant use of topical tazarotene, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend it and suggests that it increases topical inflammation, leading to lower patient compliance.[114]
</p><h3>Radiation[edit]</h3><p>Radiation therapy is often used after surgical resection for patients with locally or regionally advanced melanoma or for patients with unresectable distant metastases. Kilovoltage x-ray beams are often used for these treatments and have the property of the maximum radiation dose occurring close to the skin surface.[116] It may reduce the rate of local recurrence but does not prolong survival.[117] Radioimmunotherapy of metastatic melanoma is currently under investigation.
Radiotherapy has a role in the palliation of metastatic melanoma.[118]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Pharmacotherapy research for unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma is ongoing.[137]
</p><h3>Targeted therapies[edit]</h3><p>In clinical research, adoptive cell therapy and gene therapy, are being tested.[138]
</p><p>Two kinds of experimental treatments developed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), have been used in metastatic melanoma with tentative success.[35]
</p><p>The first treatment involves adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using TILs immune cells (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) isolated from a person's own melanoma tumor.[106] These cells are grown in large numbers in a laboratory and returned to the patient after a treatment that temporarily reduces normal T cells in the patient's body. TIL therapy following lymphodepletion can result in durable complete response in a variety of setups.[139][140]
</p><p>The second treatment, adoptive transfer of genetically altered autologous lymphocytes, depends on delivering genes that encode so called T cell receptors (TCRs), into patient's lymphocytes.[106] After that manipulation lymphocytes recognize and bind to certain molecules found on the surface of melanoma cells and kill them.[141]
</p><p>A cancer vaccine showed modest benefit in late-stage testing in 2009 against melanoma.[142][143]
</p><h3>BRAF inhibitors[edit]</h3><p>About 60% of melanomas contain a mutation in the B-Raf gene. Early clinical trials suggested that B-Raf inhibitors including Plexxicon's vemurafenib could lead to substantial tumor regression in a majority of patients if their tumor contain the B-Raf mutation.[144] In June 2011, a large clinical trial confirmed the positive findings from those earlier trials.[145][146]
</p><p>In August 2011 Vemurafenib received FDA approval for the treatment of late-stage melanoma. In May 2013 the US FDA approved dabrafenib as a single agent treatment for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive advanced melanoma.[147]
</p><p>Some researchers believe that combination therapies that simultaneously block multiple pathways may improve efficacy by making it more difficult for the tumor cells to mutate before being destroyed. In October 2012 a study reported that combining Dabrafenib with a MEK inhibitor trametinib led to even better outcomes. Compared to Dabrafenib alone, progression-free survival was increased to 41% from 9%, and the median progression-free survival increased to 9.4 months versus 5.8 months. Some side effects were, however, increased in the combined study.[148][149]
</p><p>In January 2014, the FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma.[150]
</p><p>Eventual resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors may be due to a cell surface protein known as EphA2 which is now being investigated.[151]
</p><h3>Ipilimumab[edit]</h3><p>At the American Society of Clinical Oncology Conference in June 2010, the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company reported the clinical findings of their drug ipilimumab. The study found an increase in median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one-year survival rate of 25% in the control group using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone.[152] However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional control arm, rather than comparing the drug against a placebo or standard treatment.[153][154] The criticism was that although Ipilimumab performed better than the vaccine, the vaccine has not been tested before and may be causing toxicity, making the drug appear better by comparison.
</p><p>Ipilimumab was approved by the FDA in March 2011 to treat patients with late-stage melanoma that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.[155][156][157]
</p><p>In June 2011, a clinical trial of ipilimumab plus dacarbazine combined this immune system booster with the standard chemotherapy drug that targets cell division. It showed an increase in median survival for these late stage patients to 11 months instead of the 9 months normally seen. Researchers were also hopeful of improving the five year survival rate, though serious adverse side-effects were seen in some patients. A course of treatment costs $120,000. The drug's brandname is Yervoy.[145][158]
</p><h3>Surveillance methods[edit]</h3><p>Advances in high resolution ultrasound scanning have enabled surveillance of metastatic burden to the sentinel lymph nodes.[159] The Screening and Surveillance of Ultrasound in Melanoma trial (SUNMEL) is evaluating ultrasound as an alternative to invasive surgical methods.[160]
</p><h3>Oncolytic virotherapy[edit]</h3><p>In some countries oncolytic virotherapy methods are studied and used to treat melanoma. Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising branch of virotherapy, where oncolytic viruses are used to treat diseases; viruses can increase metabolism, reduce anti-tumor immunity and disorganize vasculature.[161] Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (which is a herpes simplex virus type 1–derived oncolytic immunotherapy), was shown to be useful against metastatic melanoma in 2015 with an increased survival of 4.4 months.[162][9]
</p>"
101,migraine disorders,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Prevention of migraines</div><p>Preventive treatments of migraines include medications, nutritional supplements, lifestyle alterations, and surgery. Prevention is recommended in those who have headaches more than two days a week, cannot tolerate the medications used to treat acute attacks, or those with severe attacks that are not easily controlled.[10]
</p><p>The goal is to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and/or duration of migraines, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy.[86] Another reason for prevention is to avoid medication overuse headache. This is a common problem and can result in chronic daily headache.[87][88]
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>Preventive migraine medications are considered effective if they reduce the frequency or severity of the migraine attacks by at least 50%.[89] Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating topiramate, divalproex/sodium valproate, propranolol, and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence for first-line use.[90] Recommendations regarding effectiveness varied however for gabapentin and pregabalin.[90] Timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity, while frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine.[90] Tentative evidence also supports the use of magnesium supplementation.[91] Increasing dietary intake may be better.[92]
</p><p>Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are probably also effective.[93] Angiotensin inhibition by either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist may reduce attacks.[94]
</p><p>Medications in the anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide, including eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, appear to decrease the frequency of migraines by one to two per month.[95]
</p><h3>Alternative therapies[edit]</h3><p>While acupuncture may be effective in reducing the number of migraines, ""true"" acupuncture has only a small effect when compared to sham acupuncture, a practice where needles are placed randomly or do not penetrate the skin.[96] Both have a possibility of being similar in effectiveness to preventative medications with fewer adverse effects, however the long term effects of most migraine treatments are not known.[96] Chiropractic manipulation, physiotherapy, massage and relaxation might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches; however, the research had some problems with methodology.[97] The evidence to support spinal manipulation is poor and insufficient to support its use.[98]
</p><p>Tentative evidence supports the use of stress reduction techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques.[56] Of the alternative medicines, butterbur has the best evidence for its use.[99][100] The supplement melatonin also has modest evidence supporting its use as an add on therapy for prevention and treatment of migraine.[101] The data supporting melatonin is mixed and certain studies have had negative results.[101] The reasons for the mixed findings are unclear but may stem from differences in study design and melatonin dosage.[101] Melatonin's mechanism of action in migraine are not completely clear, however, may include improved sleep, direct action on melatonin receptors in the brain, and anti-inflammatory properties.[101][102]
</p><h3>Devices and surgery[edit]</h3><p>Medical devices, such as biofeedback and neurostimulators, have some advantages in migraine prevention, mainly when common anti-migraine medications are contraindicated or in case of medication overuse. Biofeedback helps people be conscious of some physiological parameters so as to control them and try to relax and may be efficient for migraine treatment.[103][104] Neurostimulation uses noninvasive or implantable neurostimulators similar to pacemakers for the treatment of intractable chronic migraines with encouraging results for severe cases.[105][106] A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator and a transcranial magnetic stimulator are approved in the United States for the prevention of migraines.[107][108] Migraine surgery, which involves decompression of certain nerves around the head and neck, may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medications.[109]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>There are three main aspects of treatment: trigger avoidance, acute symptomatic control, and medication for prevention.[5] Medications are more effective if used earlier in an attack.[5] The frequent use of medications may result in medication overuse headache, in which the headaches become more severe and more frequent.[12] This may occur with triptans, ergotamines, and analgesics, especially opioid analgesics.[12] Due to these concerns simple analgesics are recommended to be used less than three days per week at most.[110]
</p><h3>Analgesics[edit]</h3><p>Recommended initial treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms are simple analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the combination of paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), aspirin, and caffeine.[10] Several NSAIDs, including diclofenac and ibuprofen have evidence to support their use.[111][112] Aspirin can relieve moderate to severe migraine pain, with an effectiveness similar to sumatriptan.[113] Ketorolac is available in an intravenous formulation.[10]
</p><p>Paracetamol, either alone or in combination with metoclopramide, is another effective treatment with a low risk of adverse effects.[114] Intravenous metoclopramide is also effective by itself.[115][116] In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester.[10]
</p><h3>Triptans[edit]</h3><p>Triptans such as sumatriptan are effective for both pain and nausea in up to 75% of people.[5][117] When sumatriptan is taken with naproxen it works better.[118] They are the initially recommended treatments for those with moderate to severe pain or those with milder symptoms who do not respond to simple analgesics.[10] The different forms available include oral, injectable, nasal spray, and oral dissolving tablets.[5] In general, all the triptans appear equally effective, with similar side effects. However, individuals may respond better to specific ones.[10] Most side effects are mild, such as flushing; however, rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred.[5] They are thus not recommended for people with cardiovascular disease,[10] who have had a stroke, or have migraines that are accompanied by neurological problems.[119] In addition, triptans should be prescribed with caution for those with risk factors for vascular disease.[119] While historically not recommended in those with basilar migraines there is no specific evidence of harm from their use in this population to support this caution.[37] They are not addictive, but may cause medication-overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month.[120]
</p><h3>Ergotamines[edit]</h3><p>Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are older medications still prescribed for migraines, the latter in nasal spray and injectable forms.[5][121] They appear equally effective to the triptans[122] and experience adverse effects that typically are benign.[123] In the most severe cases, such as those with status migrainosus, they appear to be the most effective treatment option.[123] They can cause vasospasm including coronary vasospasm and are contraindicated in people with coronary artery disease.[124]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>Intravenous metoclopramide, intravenous prochlorperazine, or intranasal lidocaine are other potential options.[10][116] Metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are the recommended treatment for those who present to the emergency department.[10][116] Haloperidol may also be useful in this group.[116][121] A single dose of intravenous dexamethasone, when added to standard treatment of a migraine attack, is associated with a 26% decrease in headache recurrence in the following 72 hours.[125] Spinal manipulation for treating an ongoing migraine headache is not supported by evidence.[126] It is recommended that opioids and barbiturates not be used due to questionable efficacy, addictive potential, and the risk of rebound headache.[10]
</p><h3>Children[edit]</h3><p>Ibuprofen helps decrease pain in children with migraines. Paracetamol does not appear to be effective in providing pain relief. Triptans are effective, though there is a risk of causing minor side effects like taste disturbance, nasal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, low energy, nausea, or vomiting.[127]
</p><h3>Chronic migraine[edit]</h3><p>Topiramate and botulinum toxin (Botox) are the only medications with evidence in treating chronic migraine.[93] Botulinum toxin has been found to be useful in those with chronic migraines but not those with episodic ones.[128][129]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Calcitonin gene related peptides (CGRPs) have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine.[10] CGRP receptor antagonists, such as olcegepant and telcagepant, have been investigated both in vitro and in clinical studies for the treatment of migraine.[149] In 2011, Merck stopped phase III clinical trials for their investigational drug telcagepant.[150][151] Research as of 2016 is looking at CGRP monoclonal antibodies, of which four are in phase II development, three targeting CGRP itself and one targeting the receptor.[152] Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows promise[10][153] as does transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation.[154] There is preliminary evidence that a ketogenic diet may help prevent episodic and long-term migraine.[155]

102,mitral valve insufficiency,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatment of MR depends on the acuteness of the disease and whether there are associated signs of hemodynamic compromise. In general, medical therapy is non-curative and is used for mild-to-moderate regurgitation or in patients unable to tolerate surgery.
</p><p>In acute MR secondary to a mechanical defect in the heart (i.e., rupture of a papillary muscle or chordae tendineae), the treatment of choice is mitral valve surgery.  If the patient is hypotensive prior to the surgical procedure, an intra-aortic balloon pump may be placed in order to improve perfusion of the organs and to decrease the degree of MR.[3]
</p><h3>Medicine[edit]</h3><p>If the individual with acute MR is normotensive, vasodilators may be of use to decrease the afterload seen by the left ventricle and thereby decrease the regurgitant fraction. The vasodilator most commonly used is nitroprusside.
</p><p>Individuals with chronic MR can be treated with vasodilators as well to decrease afterload.[3] In the chronic state, the most commonly used agents are ACE inhibitors and hydralazine. Studies have shown that the use of ACE inhibitors and hydralazine can delay surgical treatment of MR.[12][13] The current guidelines for treatment of MR limit the use of vasodilators to individuals with hypertension, however. Any hypertension is treated aggressively,[4] e.g. by diuretics and a low-sodium diet.[3] In both hypertensive and normotensive cases, digoxin and antiarrhythmics are also indicated.[3][4] Also, chronic anticoagulation is given where there is concomitant mitral valve prolapse[4] or atrial fibrillation.[3]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>Surgery is curative of mitral valve regurgitation.  There are two surgical options for the treatment of MR: mitral valve replacement and mitral valve repair.[3] Mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement where a repair is feasible as bioprosthetic replacement valves have a limited lifespan of 10 to 15 years, whereas synthetic replacement valves require ongoing use of blood thinners to reduce the risk of stroke.  There are two general categories of approaches to mitral valve repair:  Resection of the prolapsed valvular segment (sometimes referred to as the 'Carpentier' approach), and installation of artificial chordae to ""anchor"" the prolapsed segment to the papillary muscle (sometimes referred to as the 'David' approach).  With the resection approach, any prolapsing tissue is resected, in effect removing the hole through which the blood is leaking.  In the artificial chordae approach, ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, or Gore-Tex) sutures are used to replace the broken or stretched chordae tendonae, bringing the natural tissue back into the physiological position, thus restoring the natural anatomy of the valve.  With both techniques, an annuloplasty ring is typically secured to the annulus, or opening of the mitral valve, to provide additional structural support.  In some cases, the ""double orifice"" (or 'Alfieri') technique for mitral valve repair, the opening of the mitral valve is sewn closed in the middle, leaving the two ends still able to open. This ensures that the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle pumps blood, yet allows the mitral valve to open at the two ends to fill  the left ventricle with blood before it pumps.  In general, mitral valve surgery  requires ""open-heart"" surgery in which the heart is arrested and the patient is placed on a heart-lung machine (cardiopulmonary bypass).  This allows the complex surgery to proceed in a still environment.
</p><p>Due to the physiological stress associated with open-heart surgery, elderly and very sick patients may be subject to increased risk, and may not be candidates for this type of surgery. As a consequence, there are attempts to identify means of correcting MR on a beating heart.  The Alfieri technique for instance, has been replicated using a percutaneous catheter technique, which installs a ""MitraClip"" device to hold the middle of the mitral valve closed.[14][15]
</p><p>Indications for surgery for chronic MR include signs of left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction less than 60%, severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 50 mmHg at rest or 60 mmHg during activity, and new onset atrial fibrillation.

103,myocardial infarction,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Main article: Management of acute coronary syndrome</div><p>A myocardial infarction requires immediate medical attention. Treatment aims to preserve as much heart muscle as possible, and to prevent further complications.[25] Treatment depends on whether the myocardial infarction is a STEMI or NSTEMI.[65] Treatment in general aims to unblock blood vessels, reduce blot clot enlargement, reduce ischemia, and modify risk factors with the aim of preventing future MIs.[25] In addition, the main treatment for myocardial infarctions with ECG evidence of ST elevation (STEMI) include thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention, although PCI is also ideally conducted within 1–3 days for NSTEMI.[65] In addition to clinical judgement, risk stratification may be used to guide treatment, such as with the TIMI and GRACE scoring systems.[16][65][88]
</p><h3>Pain[edit]</h3><p>The pain associated with myocardial infarction may be treated with nitroglycerin or morphine.[25] Nitroglycerin (given under the tongue or intravenously) may improve the blood supply to the heart, and decrease the work the heart must do.[25] It is an important part of therapy for its pain relief, despite there being no benefit to overall mortality.[25][89] Morphine may also be used, and is effective for the pain associated with STEMI.[25] The evidence for benefit from morphine on overall outcomes, however, is poor and there is some evidence of potential harm.[90][91]
</p><h3>Anticoagulation[edit]</h3><p>Aspirin, an antiplatelet anticoagulant, is given as a loading dose with the goal of reducing the clot size and reduce further clotting in the affected artery.[25][65] It is known to decrease mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction by at least 50%.[65] P2Y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor are given concurrently, also as a loading dose, with the dose depending on whether further surgical management or fibrinolysis is planned.[65] Prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended in European and American guidelines, as they are active more quickly and consistently than clopidogrel.[65] P2Y12 inhibitors are recommended in both NSTEMI and STEMI, including in PCI, with evidence also to suggest improved mortality.[65] Heparins, particularly in the unfractionated form, act at several points in the clotting cascade, help to prevent the enlargement of a clot, and are also given in myocardial infarction, owing to evidence suggesting improved mortality rates.[65] In very high-risk scenarios, inhibitors of the platelet glycoprotein αIIbβ3a receptor such as eptifibatide or tirofiban may be used.[65]
</p><p>There is varying evidence on the mortality benefits in NSTEMI. A 2014 review of P2Y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel found they do not change the risk of death when given to people with a suspected NSTEMI prior to PCI,[92] nor do heparins change the risk of death.[93] They do decrease the risk of having a further myocardial infarction.[65][93]
</p><h3>Angiogram[edit]</h3><p>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the treatment of choice for STEMI if it can be performed in a timely manner, ideally within 90–120 minutes of contact with a medical provider.[65][94] Some recommend it is also done in NSTEMI within 1–3 days, particularly when considered high-risk.[65] A 2017 review, however, did not find a difference between early versus later PCI in NSTEMI.[95]
</p><p>PCI involves small probes, inserted through peripheral blood vessels such as the femoral artery or radial artery into the blood vessels of the heart. The probes are then used to identify and clear blockages using small balloons, which are dragged through the blocked segment, dragging away the clot, or the insertion of stents.[25][65] Coronary artery bypass grafting is only considered when the affected area of heart muscle large, and PCI is unsuitable, for example with difficult cardiac anatomy.[96] After PCI, people are generally placed on aspirin indefinitely and on dual antiplatelet therapy (generally aspirin and clopidogrel) for at least a year.[19][65][97]
</p><h3>Fibrinolysis[edit]</h3><p>If PCI cannot be performed within 90 to 120 minutes in STEMI then fibrinolysis, preferably within 30 minutes of arrival to hospital, is recommended.[65][98] If a person has had symptoms for 12 to 24 hours evidence for effectiveness of thrombolysis is less and if they have had symptoms for more than 24 hours it is not recommended.[99] Thrombolysis involves the administration of medication that activates the enzymes that normally dissolve blood clots. These medications include tissue plasminogen activator, reteplase, streptokinase, and tenecteplase.[25] Thrombolysis is not recommended in a number of situations, particularly when associated with a high risk of bleeding or the potential for problematic bleeding, such as active bleeding, past strokes or bleeds into the brain, or severe hypertension. Situations in which thrombolysis may be considered, but with caution, include recent surgery, use of anticoagulants, pregnancy, and proclivity to bleeding.[25] Major risks of thrombolysis are major bleeding and intracranial bleeding.[25] Pre-hospital thrombolysis reduces time to thrombolytic treatment, based on studies conducted in higher income countries, however it is unclear whether this has an impact on mortality rates.[100]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>In the past, high flow oxygen was recommended for everyone with a possible myocardial infarction.[76] More recently, no evidence was found for routine use in those with normal oxygen levels and there is potential harm from the intervention.[101][102][103][104] Therefore, oxygen is currently only recommended if oxygen levels are found to be low or if someone is in respiratory distress.[25][76]
</p><p>If despite thrombolysis there is significant cardiogenic shock, continued severe chest pain, or less than a 50% improvement in ST elevation on the ECG recording after 90 minutes, then rescue PCI is indicated emergently.[105][106]
</p><p>Those who have had cardiac arrest may benefit from targeted temperature management with evaluation for implementation of hypothermia protocols. Furthermore, those with cardiac arrest, and ST elevation at any time, should usually have angiography.[19] Aldosterone antagonists appear to be useful in people who have had an STEMI and do not have heart failure.[107]
</p><h3>Rehabilitation[edit]</h3><p>Cardiac rehabilitation benefits many who have experienced myocardial infarction,[65] even if there has been substantial heart damage and resultant left ventricular failure. It should start soon after discharge from the hospital. The program may include lifestyle advice, exercise, social support, as well as recommendations about driving, flying, sport participation, stress management, and sexual intercourse.[108]
</p><h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>There is a large crossover between the lifestyle and activity recommendations to prevent a myocardial infarction, and those that may be adopted as secondary prevention after an initial myocardial infarction,[65] because of shared risk factors and an aim to reduce atherosclerosis affecting heart vessels.[25]
</p><h3>Primary prevention[edit]</h3><h4>Lifestyle[edit]</h4><p>Physical activity can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and people at risk are advised to engage in 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise a week.[109] Keeping a healthy weight, drinking alcohol within the recommended limits, and quitting smoking reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.[109]
</p><p>Substituting polyunsaturated fats such as olive oil and rapeseed oil instead of saturated fats may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction,[41] although there is not universal agreement.[42] Dietary modifications are recommended by some national authorities, with recommendations including increasing the intake of wholegrain starch, reducing sugar intake (particularly of refined sugar), consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, consuming two or more portions of fish per week, and consuming 4–5 portions of unsalted nuts, seeds, or legumes per week.[109] The dietary pattern with the greatest support is the Mediterranean diet.[110] Vitamins and mineral supplements are of no proven benefit,[111] and neither are plant stanols or sterols.[109]
</p><p>Public health measures may also act at a population level to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, for example by reduce unhealthy diets (excessive salt, saturated fat and trans fat) including food labeling and marketing requirements as well as requirements for catering and restaurants, and stimulating physical activity. This may be part of regional cardiovascular disease prevention programs, or through the health impact assessment of regional and local plans and policies.[112]
</p><p>Most guidelines recommend combining different preventive strategies. A 2015 Cochrane Review found some evidence that such an approach might help with blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference. However, there was insufficient evidence to show an effect on mortality or actual cardio-vascular events.[113]
</p><h4>Medication[edit]</h4><p>Statins, drugs that act to lower blood cholesterol, decrease the incidence and mortality rates of myocardial infarctions.[114] They are often recommended in those at an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases.[109]
</p><p>Aspirin has been studied extensively in people considered at increased risk of myocardial infarction. Based on numerous studies in different groups (e.g. people with or without diabetes), there does not appear to be a benefit strong enough to outweigh the risk of excessive bleeding.[115][116] Nevertheless, many clinical practice guidelines continue to recommend aspirin for primary prevention,[117] and some researchers feel that those with very high cardiovascular risk but low risk of bleeding should continue to receive aspirin.[118]
</p><h3>Secondary prevention[edit]</h3><p>There is a large crossover between the lifestyle and activity recommendations to prevent a myocardial infarction, and those that may be adopted as secondary prevention after an initial myocardial infarct.[65] Recommendations include stopping smoking, a gradual return to exercise, eating a healthy diet, low in saturated fat and low in cholesterol, and drinking alcohol within recommended limits, exercising, and trying to achieve a healthy weight.[65][108] Exercise is both safe and effective even if people have had stents or heart failure,[119] and is recommended to start gradually after 1–2 weeks.[65] Counselling should be provided relating to medications used, and for warning signs of depression.[65] Previous studies suggested a benefit from omega-3 fatty acid supplementation but this has not been confirmed.[108]
</p><h4>Medications[edit]</h4><p>Following a heart attack, nitrates, when taken for two days, and ACE-inhibitors decrease the risk of death.[120] Other medications include:
</p><p>Aspirin is continued indefinitely, as well as another antiplatelet agent such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor (""dual antiplatelet therapy"" or DAPT) for up to twelve months.[108] If someone has another medical condition that requires anticoagulation (e.g. with warfarin) this may need to be adjusted based on risk of further cardiac events as well as bleeding risk.[108] In those who have had a stent, more than 12 months of clopidogrel plus aspirin does not affect the risk of death.[121]
</p><p>Beta blocker therapy such as metoprolol or carvedilol is recommended to be started within 24 hours, provided there is no acute heart failure or heart block.[19][76] The dose should be increased to the highest tolerated.[108] Contrary to what was long believed, the use of beta blockers does not appear to affect the risk of death, possibly because other treatments for MI have improved.[122] When beta blocker medication is given within the first 24–72 hours of a STEMI no lives are saved. However, 1 in 200 people were prevented from a repeat heart attack, and another 1 in 200 from having an abnormal heart rhythm. Additionally, for 1 in 91 the medication causes a temporary decrease in the heart's ability to pump blood.[123]
</p><p>ACE inhibitor therapy should be started within 24 hours, and continued indefinitely at the highest tolerated dose. This is provided there is no evidence of worsening kidney failure, high potassium, low blood pressure, or known narrowing of the renal arteries.[65] Those who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors may be treated with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.[108]
</p><p>Statin therapy has been shown to reduce mortality and subsequent cardiac events, and should be commenced with the aim of lowering LDL cholesterol. Other medications, such as ezetimibe, may also be added with this goal in mind.[65]
</p><p>Aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) may be used if there is evidence of left ventricular dysfunction after an MI, ideally after beginning treatment with an ACE inhibitor.[108][124]
</p><h4>Other[edit]</h4><p>A defibrillator, an electric device connected to the heart and surgically inserted under the skin, may be recommended. This is particularly if there are any ongoing signs of heart failure, with a low left ventricular ejection fraction and a New York Heart Association grade II or III after 40 days of the infarction.[65] Defibrillators detect potentially fatal arrhythmia and deliver an electrical shock to the person to depolarize a critical mass of the heart muscle.[125]

104,neoplasm,"<h2>What Are the Treatments for Kidney Cancer?</h2><p>Once you have a diagnosis and know your stage of kidney cancer, you and your doctor can plan treatment. You may want to gather information to help you feel more informed about your decision. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist for treatment. This could include an urologist, a medical or radiation oncologist, or a surgeon. Before beginning treatment, many people find it helpful to get a second opinion about the diagnosis of kidney cancer and the treatment plan.</p><p>Kidney cancer is one of the more common cancers to undergo spontaneous regression, in which it may return to an eralier stage. However, the incidence is quite low (approximately 0.5%).</p><p>There are several standard types of treatment for kidney cancer. In most cases, surgery is the first step. Even if surgery removes the entire tumor, though, your doctor may suggest an extra treatment to kill any remaining cancer cells that can't be seen.</p><p>
Surgery for kidney cancer
</p><p>These are the main types of surgery for kidney cancer. Which type you have depends on how advanced your cancer is.</p><ul>

Radical nephrectomy removes the kidney, adrenal gland, and surrounding tissue. It also often removes nearby lymph nodes. It is the most common surgery for kidney cancer and can now be done through a small incision with a laparoscope.

Simple nephrectomy removes the kidney only.

Partial nephrectomy removes the cancer in the kidney along with some tissue around it. This procedure is used for patients with smaller tumors (less than 4 cm) or in those patients in which a radical nephrectomy might hurt the other kidney.
</ul><p>You can survive with just a part of one kidney as long as it is still working. If the surgeon removes both kidneys or if both kidneys are not working, you will need a machine to clean your blood (dialysis) or a new kidney (kidney transplant). A transplant is possible if your cancer was found only in your kidney and a donated kidney is available.</p><p>If surgery can't remove your kidney cancer, your doctor may suggest another option to help destroy the tumor.</p><ul>

Cryotherapy uses extreme cold to kill the tumor.

Radiofrequency ablation uses high-energy radio waves to ""cook"" the tumor.

Arterial embolization involves inserting material into an artery that leads to the kidney. This blocks blood flow to the tumor. This procedure may be done to help shrink the tumor before surgery.
</ul><h2>How Can I Prevent Kidney Cancer?</h2><p>Because doctors don't know the causes of kidney cancer, it is not clear how to prevent the disease. However, certain factors are linked to kidney cancer, so you can take certain steps to lower your risk -- quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight, manage your blood pressure, and avoid being exposed to harmful chemicals.</p>"
105,neoplasm metastasis,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Treatment and survival is determined, to a great extent, by whether or not a cancer remains localized or spreads to other locations in the body. If the cancer metastasizes to other tissues or organs it usually dramatically increases a patient's likelihood of death. Some cancers—such as some forms of leukemia, a cancer of the blood, or malignancies in the brain—can kill without spreading at all.
</p><p>Once a cancer has metastasized it may still be treated with radiosurgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, hormone therapy, surgery, or a combination of these interventions (""multimodal therapy""). The choice of treatment depends on a large number of factors, including the type of primary cancer, the size and location of the metastases, the patient's age and general health, and the types of treatments used previously. In patients diagnosed with CUP it is often still possible to treat the disease even when the primary tumor cannot be located.
</p><p>Current treatments are rarely able to cure metastatic cancer though some tumors, such as testicular cancer and thyroid cancer, are usually curable.
</p><p>Palliative care, care aimed at improving the quality of life of people with major illness, has been recommended as part of management programs for metastasis.[38]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Although metastasis is widely accepted to be the result of the tumor cells migration, there is a hypothesis saying that some metastases are the result of inflammatory processes by abnormal immune cells.[39]  The existence of metastatic cancers in the absence of primary tumors also suggests that metastasis is not always caused by malignant cells that leave primary tumors.[40]
</p>"
106,neuropathy,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatment of peripheral neuropathy varies based on the cause of the condition, and treating the underlying condition can aid in the management of neuropathy. When peripheral neuropathy results from diabetes mellitus or prediabetes, blood sugar management is key to treatment. In prediabetes in particular, strict blood sugar control can significantly alter the course of neuropathy.[25] In peripheral neuropathy that stems from immune-mediated diseases, the underlying condition is treated with intravenous immunoglobulin or steroids. When peripheral neuropathy results from vitamin deficiencies or other disorders, those are treated as well.[25]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>A range of medications that act on the central nervous system has been found to be useful in managing neuropathic pain. Commonly used treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline or amitriptyline), the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medication duloxetine, and antiepileptic therapies such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or sodium valproate. Few studies have examined whether nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in treating peripheral neuropathy.[37]
</p><p>Symptomatic relief for the pain of peripheral neuropathy may be obtained by application of topical capsaicin. Capsaicin is the factor that causes heat in chili peppers. The evidence suggesting that capsaicin applied to the skin reduces pain for peripheral neuropathy is of moderate to low quality and should be interpreted carefully before using this treatment option.[38]
</p><p>Evidence supports the use of cannabinoids for some forms of neuropathic pain.[39]
</p><h3>Medical devices[edit]</h3><p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy may be effective and safe in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. A recent review of three trials involving 78 patients found some improvement in pain scores after 4 and 6, but not 12 weeks of treatment and an overall improvement in neuropathic symptoms at 12 weeks.[40] Another review of four trials found significant improvement in pain and overall symptoms, with 38% of patients in one trial becoming asymptomatic. The treatment remains effective even after prolonged use, but symptoms return to baseline within a month of cessation of treatment.[41]
</p><h3>Stem cells[edit]</h3><p>Stem-cell therapy is also being looked at as a possible means to repair peripheral nerve damage, however efficacy has not yet been demonstrated.[42][43][44][45]
</p><h3>Diet[edit]</h3><p>A strict gluten-free diet is an effective treatment when neuropathy is caused by gluten sensitivity, with or without the presence of digestive symptoms or intestinal injury.[7]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>A 2008 literature review concluded that, ""based on principles of evidence-based medicine and evaluations of methodology, there is only a 'possible' association [of celiac disease and peripheral neuropathy], due to lower levels of evidence and conflicting evidence. There is not yet convincing evidence of causality.""[46]
</p><p>A 2019 review concluded that ""gluten neuropathy is a slowly progressive condition. About 25% of the patients will have evidence of enteropathy on biopsy (CD [celiac disease]) but the presence or absence of an enteropathy does not influence the positive effect of a strict gluten-free diet.""[7]
</p>"
107,neutropenia,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor preparations, such as filgrastim[20] can be effective in people with congenital forms of neutropenia including severe congenital neutropenia and cyclic neutropenia;[21] the amount needed (dosage) to stabilize the neutrophil count varies considerably (depending on the individual's condition).[22] Guidelines for neutropenia regarding diet are currently being studied.[23]
</p><p>Most cases of neonatal neutropenia are temporary. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended because of the possibility of encouraging the development of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains.[1]
</p><p>Neutropenia can be treated with hematopoietic growth factors, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These are cytokines (inflammation-inducing chemicals) that are present naturally in the body. These factors are used regularly in cancer treatment with adults and children. The factors promote neutrophil recovery following anticancer therapy.[1]
</p><p>The administration of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) has had some success in treating neutropenias of alloimmune and autoimmune origins with a response rate of about 50%. Blood transfusions have not been effective.[1]

</p><p>Underlying immunosuppression may be medically manageable once it is identified, and this helps prevent recurrence of candidal infections.
</p><p>Patients who are immunocompromised, either with HIV/AIDS or as a result of chemotherapy, may require systemic prevention or treatment with oral or intravenous administered anti-fungals. However there is strong evidence that drugs that are absorbed or partially absorbed from the GI tract can prevent candidiasis more effectively than drugs that are not absorbed in the same way.[34]
</p><p>If candidiasis is secondary to corticosteroid or antibiotic use, then use may be stopped, although this is not always a feasible option.  Candidiasis secondary to the use of inhaled steroids may be treated by rinsing out the mouth with water after taking the steroid.[15] Use of a spacer device to reduce the contact with the oral mucosa may greatly reduce the risk of oral candidiasis.[25]
</p><p>In recurrent oral candidiasis, the use of azole antifungals risks selection and enrichment of drug-resistant strains of candida organisms.[30] Drug resistance is increasingly more common and presents a serious problem in persons who are immunocompromised.[13]
</p><p>Prophylactic use of antifungals is sometimes employed in persons with HIV disease, during radiotherapy, during immunosuppressive or prolonged antibiotic therapy as the development of candidal infection in these groups may be more serious.[2]
</p><p>The candidal load in the mouth can be reduced by improving oral hygiene measures, such as regular toothbrushing and use of anti-microbial mouthwashes.[18] Since smoking is associated with many of forms of oral candidiasis, cessation may be beneficial.[medical citation needed]
</p><h3>Denture hygiene[edit]</h3><div>See also: Denture-related stomatitis § Treatment</div><p>Good denture hygiene involves regular cleaning of the dentures, and leaving them out of the mouth during sleep. This gives the mucosa a chance to recover, while wearing a denture during sleep is often likened to sleeping in one's shoes. In oral candidiasis, the dentures may act as a reservoir of Candida species,[7] continually reinfecting the mucosa once antifungal medication is stopped. Therefore, they must be disinfected as part of the treatment for oral candidiasis. There are commercial denture cleaner preparations for this purpose, but it is readily accomplished by soaking the denture overnight in a 1:10 solution of sodium hypochlorite (Milton, or household bleach).[7] Bleach may corrode metal components,[13] so if the denture contains metal, soaking it twice daily in chlorhexidine solution can be carried out instead. An alternative method of disinfection is to use a 10% solution of acetic acid (vinegar) as an overnight soak, or to microwave the dentures in 200mL water for 3 minutes at 650 watts.[13] Microwave sterilization is only suitable if no metal components are present in the denture. Antifungal medication can also be applied to the fitting surface of the denture before it is put back in the mouth. Other problems with the dentures, such as inadequate occlusal vertical dimension may also need to be corrected in the case of angular cheilitis.

111,osteomyelitis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Osteomyelitis often requires prolonged antibiotic therapy for weeks or months. A PICC line or central venous catheter can be placed for long-term intravenous medication administration. Some studies of children with acute osteomyelitis report that antibiotic by mouth may be justified due to PICC-related complications.[24][25] It may require surgical debridement in severe cases, or even amputation. Antibiotics by mouth and by intravenous appear similar.[26][27]
</p><p>Initial first-line antibiotic choice is determined by the patient's history and regional differences in common infective organisms. A treatment lasting 42 days is practiced in a number of facilities.[28] Local and sustained availability of drugs have proven to be more effective in achieving prophylactic and therapeutic outcomes.[29] Open surgery is needed for chronic osteomyelitis, whereby the involucrum is opened and the sequestrum is removed or sometimes saucerization[30] can be done. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to be a useful adjunct to the treatment of refractory osteomyelitis.[31][32]
</p><p>Before the widespread availability and use of antibiotics, blow fly larvae were sometimes deliberately introduced to the wounds to feed on the infected material, effectively scouring them clean.[33][34] In 1875, American artist Thomas Eakins depicted a surgical procedure for osteomyelitis at Jefferson Medical College, in a famous oil painting titled The Gross Clinic.
</p><p>There is tentative evidence that bioactive glass may also be useful in long bone infections.[35] Support from randomized controlled trials, however, is not available as of 2015.[36]
</p>"
112,osteoporosis,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Lifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors.[88] As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it.[89]
</p><p>In people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis[90] and increases bone density.[58] The diet must ensure optimal calcium intake (of at least one gram daily) and measuring vitamin D levels is recommended, and to take specific supplements if necessary.[90]
</p><h3>Nutrition[edit]</h3><div> Global dietary calcium intake among adults (mg/day).[91] .mw-parser-output .refbegin{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul{list-style-type:none;margin-left:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul>li,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>dl>dd{margin-left:0;padding-left:3.2em;text-indent:-3.2em;list-style:none}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-100{font-size:100%}   <400  400-500  500-600  600-700  700-800  800-900  900-1000  >1000 </div><div> Global vitamin D serum levels among adults (nmol/L).[92][93]  > 75  50-74  25-49</div><p>Studies of the benefits of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D are conflicting, possibly because most studies did not have people with low dietary intakes.[94] A 2018 review by the USPSTF found low-quality evidence that the routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements (or both supplements together) did not reduce the risk of having an osteoporotic fracture in male and female adults living in the community who had no known history of vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a fracture.[95] Furthermore, the same review found moderate-quality evidence that the combination of vitamin D and calcium supplementation increases the risk for developing kidney stones in this population.[95] The evidence was insufficient to determine if supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, or the combination of both had an effect on the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or death from any cause.[95] The USPSTF does not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1 g of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk.[96] A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures.[97]
</p><p>While some meta-analyses have found a benefit of vitamin D supplements combined with calcium for fractures, they did not find a benefit of vitamin D supplements (800 IU/day or less) alone.[98][99]
</p><p>While supplementation does not appear to affect the risk of death,[95][99] there is an increased risk of myocardial infarctions with calcium supplementation,[100][101] kidney stones,[95] and stomach problems.[99]
</p><p>Vitamin K deficiency is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. The gene gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) is dependent on vitamin K. Functional polymorphisms in the gene could attribute to variation in bone metabolism and BMD. Vitamin K2 is also used as a means of treatment for osteoporosis and the polymorphisms of GGCX could explain the individual variation in the response to treatment of vitamin K.[102]
</p><h3>Physical exercise[edit]</h3><p>A 2011 review reported a small benefit of physical exercise on bone density of postmenopausal women.[103] The chances of having a fracture were also slightly reduced (absolute difference 4%).[103] People who exercised had on average less bone loss (0.85% at the spine, 1.03% at the hip).[103]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><p>Weight-bearing endurance exercise and/or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis.[103][104] Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women.[103] Fall prevention can help prevent osteoporosis complications. There is some evidence for hip protectors specifically among those who are in care homes.[105]
</p><h3>Medications[edit]</h3><p>Bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis.[5][6][89] This benefit is present when taken for three to four years.[106] Different bisphosphonates have not been directly compared, therefore it is unknown if one is better than another.[89] Fracture risk reduction is between 25 and 70% depending on the bone involved.[89] There are concerns of atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw with long-term use, but these risks are low.[89][107] With evidence of little benefit when used for more than three to five years and in light of the potential adverse events, it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time.[106] One medical organization recommends that after five years of medications by mouth or three years of intravenous medication among those at low risk, bisphosphonate treatment can be stopped.[108][109] In those at higher risk they recommend up to ten years of medication by mouth or six years of intravenous treatment.[108]
</p><p>For those with osteoporosis but who have not had a fracture evidence does not support a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate[6] or etidronate.[9] Alendronate decreases fractures of the spine but does not have any effect on other types of fractures.[5] Half stop their medications within a year.[110] When on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed.[109] Another review found tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis.[111]
</p><p>Fluoride supplementation does not appear to be effective in postmenopausal osteoporosis, as even though it increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures.[112][113]
</p><p>Teriparatide (a recombinant parathyroid hormone) has been shown to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.[114] Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.[115] Hormone replacement therapy, while effective for osteoporosis, is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms.[89] It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself.[109] Raloxifene, while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures, does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture.[89] And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes.[89] While denosumab is effective at preventing fractures in women,[89] there is not clear evidence of benefit in males.[111] In hypogonadal men, testosterone has been shown to improve bone quantity and quality, but, as of 2008, no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with a normal testosterone levels.[57] Calcitonin while once recommended is no longer due to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk.[116]
</p><p>Certain medications like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and strontium ranelate can help to prevent osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.[117]

114,pancreatitis,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatment of pancreatitis is supportive and depends on severity. Morphine generally is suitable for pain control. There are no clinical studies to suggest that morphine can aggravate or cause pancreatitis or cholecystitis.[30]
</p><p>The treatment for acute pancreatitis will depend on whether the diagnosis is for the mild form of the condition, which causes no complications, or the severe form, which can cause serious complications.
</p><h3>Mild acute pancreatitis[edit]</h3><p>The treatment of mild acute pancreatitis is successfully carried out by admission to a general hospital ward. Traditionally, people were not allowed to eat until the inflammation resolved but more recent evidence suggests early feeding is safe and improves outcomes. Because pancreatitis can cause lung damage and affect normal lung function, oxygen is occasionally delivered through breathing tubes that are connected via the nose. The tubes can then be removed after a few days once it is clear that the condition is improving. Dehydration may result during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids will be provided intravenously. Opioids may be used for the pain. Early feeding does not appear to cause problems and may result in an ability to leave hospital sooner.[31]
</p><h3>Severe acute pancreatitis[edit]</h3><p>Severe pancreatitis can cause organ failure, necrosis, infected necrosis, pseudocyst, and abscess. If diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, people will need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit. It is likely that the levels of fluids inside the body will have dropped significantly as it diverts bodily fluids and nutrients in an attempt to repair the pancreas. The drop in fluid levels can lead to a reduction in the volume of blood within the body, which is known as hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock can be life-threatening as it can very quickly starve the body of the oxygen-rich blood that it needs to survive. To avoid going into hypovolemic shock, fluids will be pumped intravenously. Oxygen will be supplied through tubes attached to the nose and ventilation equipment may be used to assist with breathing. Feeding tubes may be used to provide nutrients, combined with appropriate analgesia.
</p><p>As with mild acute pancreatitis, it will be necessary to treat the underlying cause—gallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol, etc. If the cause is gallstones, it is likely that an ERCP procedure or removal of the gallbladder will be recommended. The gallbladder should be removed during the same hospital admission or within two weeks of pancreatitis onset so as to limit the risk of recurrent pancreatitis.
</p><p>If the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol, cessation of alcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis. Even if the underlying cause is not related to alcohol consumption, doctors recommend avoiding it for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process.[32] Oral intake, especially fats, is generally restricted initially but early enteral feeding within 48 hours has been shown to improve clinical outcomes.[33] Fluids and electrolytes are replaced intravenously. Nutritional support is initiated via tube feeding to surpass the portion of the digestive tract most affected by secreted pancreatic enzymes if there is no improvement in the first 72–96 hours of treatment.[34]

116,paranoia,"Treatment
While there is no absolute cure for the conditions that cause paranoia, treatment can help the person cope with their symptoms and live a happier, more productive life. Treatment depends on the type and severity of the condition but may include:

    Medications – anti-anxiety drugs or antipsychotic drugs can ease some of the symptoms. However, a person with paranoia may often refuse to take medication because they are afraid it will harm them.
    Therapy – this can help the person to cope with their symptoms and may improve their ability to function. However, a person with paranoia is unlikely to talk openly and freely to a therapist, so progress can be extremely slow.
    Coping skills – other treatments aim to improve the person’s ability to function socially. Options may include relaxation therapy, techniques to reduce anxiety, and behaviour modification.
    Hospital admission – in severe cases, the person may need to stay in hospital until the condition causing paranoia stabilises.

117,parkinson disease,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>Exercise in middle age may reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease later in life.[12] Caffeine also appears protective with a greater decrease in risk occurring with a larger intake of caffeinated beverages such as coffee.[78] People who smoke cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco are less likely than non-smokers to develop PD, and the more they have used tobacco, the less likely they are to develop PD.  It is not known what underlies this effect. Tobacco use may actually protect against PD, or it may be that an unknown factor both increases the risk of PD and causes an aversion to tobacco or makes it easier to quit using tobacco.[79]
</p><p>Antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, have been proposed to protect against the disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven.[48] The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects.[48] There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective.[4] A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.[80]
</p><h2>Management</h2><div>Main article: Management of Parkinson's disease</div><div> Pharmacological treatment of Parkinson's disease</div><p>There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but medications, surgery, and physical treatment can provide relief and are much more effective than treatments available for other neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, motor neuron disease, and Parkinson plus syndromes.  The main families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are levodopa (always combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and sometimes also with a COMT inhibitor), dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors. The stage of the disease and the age at disease onset determine which group is most useful.[81]
</p><p>Braak staging of Parkinson's disease gives six stages, that can be used to identify early stages, later stages, and late stages. The initial stage in which some disability has already developed and requires pharmacological treatment is followed by later stages associated with the development of complications related to levodopa usage, and a third stage when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or levodopa treatment may predominate.[82]
</p><p>Treatment in the first stage aims for an optimal trade-off between symptom control and treatment side-effects. The start of levodopa treatment may be postponed by initially using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists instead, in the hope of delaying the onset of complications due to levodopa use.[83] However, levodopa is still the most effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD and should not be delayed in patients when their quality of life is impaired. Levodopa-related dyskinesias correlate more strongly with duration and severity of the disease than duration of levodopa treatment, so delaying this therapy may not provide much longer dyskinesia-free time than early use.[84]
</p><p>In later stages the aim is to reduce PD symptoms while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or its overuse have to be managed.[83] When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use.[85]Late stage PD presents many challenges requiring a variety of treatments including those for psychiatric symptoms particularly depression, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction and erectile dysfunction.[85] In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.[86]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><h4>Levodopa</h4><p>The motor symptoms of PD are the result of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a precursor of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor symptoms of PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.[83]
</p><p>Only 5–10% of levodopa crosses the blood–brain barrier. Much of the remainder is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension.[87] Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.[88]
</p><p>Levodopa-use leads in the long term to the development of complications: involuntary movements called dyskinesias, and fluctuations in the effectiveness of the medication.[83] When fluctuations occur, a person can cycle through phases with good response to medication and reduced PD symptoms (""on"" state), and phases with poor response to medication and significant PD symptoms (""off"" state).[83] Using lower doses of levodopa may reduce the risk and severity of these levodopa-induced complications.[89] A former strategy to reduce levodopa-related dyskinesia and fluctuations was to withdraw levodopa medication for some time. This is now discouraged since it can bring on dangerous side effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[83] Most people with PD will eventually need levodopa and will later develop levodopa-induced fluctuations and dyskinesias.[83]
</p><p>There are controlled-release versions of levodopa. Older controlled-release levodopa preparations have poor and unreliable absorption and bioavailability and have not demonstrated improved control of PD motor symptoms or a reduction in levodopa-related complications when compared to immediate release preparations. A newer extended-release levodopa preparation does seem to be more effective in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by gastroparesis. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.[88]
</p><h4>COMT inhibitors</h4><p>Tolcapone inhibits the activity COMT, an enzyme which degrades dopamine.[83] It has been used to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible complications such as liver damage.[83] A similarly effective drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function.[83] Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.[83]
</p><h4>Dopamine agonists</h4><p>Several dopamine agonists that bind to dopamine receptors in the brain have similar effects to levodopa.[83] These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications.[83][90] Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.
</p><p>Though dopamine agonists are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, they are usually effective enough to manage these symptoms in the first years of treatment.[10] Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset.[10] Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.[10]
</p><p>Dopamine agonists produce significant, although usually mild, side effects including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation.[83] Sometimes side effects appear even at a minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician to search for a different drug.[83] Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa.[91] They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.[10]
</p><p>Apomorphine, a non-orally administered dopamine agonist, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD.[83] It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions.[83] Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored.[83] Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.[92]
</p><h4>MAO-B inhibitors</h4><p>MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, selegiline and rasagiline) increase the amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine.[83] Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods.[83] An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.[83]
</p><h4>Other drugs</h4><div>Main article: Antiparkinson medication</div><p>Other drugs such as amantadine and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments.[83] In addition to motor symptoms, PD is accompanied by a diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems.[93] Examples are the use of quetiapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for daytime sleepiness.[93][94] In 2016 pimavanserin was approved for the management of Parkinson's disease psychosis.[95]
</p><p>Doxepin and rasagline may reduce physical fatigue in PD.[96]
</p><h3>Surgery</h3><div> Placement of an electrode into the brain. The head is stabilised in a frame for stereotactic surgery.</div><p>Treating motor symptoms with surgery was once a common practice, but since the discovery of levodopa, the number of operations has declined.[97] Studies in the past few decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, so that surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient.[97] Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups: lesional and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Target areas for DBS or lesions include the thalamus, the globus pallidus  or the subthalamic nucleus.[97]  Deep brain stimulation is the most commonly used surgical treatment, developed in the 1980s by Alim Louis Benabid and others. It involves the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator, which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication, as long as they do not have severe neuropsychiatric problems.[98] Other, less common, surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific subcortical areas. For example, pallidotomy involves surgical destruction of the globus pallidus to control dyskinesia.[97]
</p><p>Fours areas of the brain have been treated with neural stimulators in PD.[99] These are the globus pallidus interna, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and the pedunculopontine nucleus. DBS of the globus pallidus interna improves motor function while DBS of the thalamic DBS improves tremor but has little effect on bradykinesia or rigidity. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is usually avoided if a history of depression or neurocognitive impairment is present. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is associated with reduction in medication. Pedunculopontine nucleus DBS remains experimental at present. Generally DBS is associated with 30–60% improvement in motor score evaluations.
</p><h3>Rehabilitation</h3><div>Further information: Rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease</div><p>Exercise programs are recommended in people with Parkinson's disease.[12] There is some evidence that speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality.[100][101] Regular physical exercise with or without physical therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life.[101] When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, there are more improvements in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared to a self-supervised exercise program at home.[102] In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques.[103] As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on, but are not limited to improving gait speed, the base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and altering environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed).[104] Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken. Therefore, it is recommended that people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are at their best.[105] Also, due to the forward flexed posture, and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson's disease,  deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest wall mobility and vital capacity.[106] Exercise may improve constipation.[11] It is unclear if exercise reduces physical fatigue in PD.[96]
</p><p>One of the most widely practiced treatments for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT).[100][107] Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech.[100] Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible.[100] There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life for the duration of the therapy.[100][108]
</p><h3>Palliative care</h3><p>Palliative care is specialized medical care for people with serious illnesses, including Parkinson's. The goal of this speciality is to improve quality of life for both the person with Parkinson's and the family by providing relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of illnesses.[109] As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.[110]
</p><p>Palliative care should be involved earlier, rather than later in the disease course.[111][112]  Palliative care specialists can help with physical symptoms, emotional factors such as loss of function and jobs, depression, fear, and existential concerns.[111][112][113]
</p><p>Along with offering emotional support to both the patient and family, palliative care serves an important role in addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care.[110] Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.[112][114]
</p><p>Muscles and nerves that control the digestive process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach for a longer period than normal).[11] A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction.[11] As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.[11]
</p><p>Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access.[11] When they are taken together, this results in a reduced effectiveness of the drug.[11] Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons.[11] To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals.[11] At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.[11]
</p><h2>Research</h2><div>See also: Parkinson's disease clinical research</div><p>There is little prospect of significant new PD treatments in the near future.[139] Currently active research directions include the search for new animal models of the disease and studies of the potential usefulness of gene therapy, stem cell transplants and neuroprotective agents.[62]
</p><h3>Animal models</h3><p>PD is not known to occur naturally in any species other than humans, although animal models which show some features of the disease are used in research. The appearance of parkinsonism in a group of drug addicts in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated batch of the synthetic opiate MPPP led to the discovery of the chemical MPTP as an agent that causes parkinsonism in non-human primates as well as in humans.[140] Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide rotenone, the herbicide paraquat and the fungicide maneb.[141] Models based on toxins are most commonly used in primates.  Transgenic rodent models that replicate various aspects of PD have been developed.[142] The use of neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, creates a model of Parkinson's disease in rats by targeting and destroying dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway when injected into the substantia nigra.[143]
</p><h3>Gene therapy</h3><p>Gene therapy typically involves the use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage.[62][144] In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD.[62] There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown.[62] One of these reported positive results in 2011,[145] but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.[146]
</p><h3>Neuroprotective treatments</h3><div> Several chemical compounds, such as GDNF (chemical structure pictured) have been proposed as neuroprotectors in PD, but their effectiveness has not been proven.</div><p>Investigations on neuroprotection are at the forefront of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments.[62] However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration.[62] Agents currently under investigation include, antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF).[62] Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein.[139] A vaccine that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.[147] In 2018 another vaccine, PRX002/RG7935, has passed stage I trials and has been supported for stage II trials.[148]
</p><h3>Cell-based therapies</h3><div>Main article: Cell-based therapies for Parkinson's disease</div><p>Since early in the 1980s, fetal, porcine, carotid or retinal tissues have been used in cell transplants, in which dissociated cells are injected into the substantia nigra in the hope that they will incorporate themselves into the brain in a way that replaces the dopamine-producing cells that have been lost.[62]  Although there was initial evidence of mesencephalic dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, double-blind trials to date indicate that cell transplants produce no long-term benefit.[62] An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue, leading to dystonias.[149] Stem cell transplants are a recent research target, because stem cells are easy to manipulate and stem cells transplanted into the brains of rodents and monkeys have been found to survive and reduce behavioral abnormalities.[62][150] Nevertheless, use of fetal stem cells is controversial.[62] It has been proposed that effective treatments may be developed in a less controversial way by use of induced pluripotent stem cells taken from adults.[62]
</p><h3>Other</h3><p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias.[151] Its usefulness in PD is an open research topic.[152] Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however there is no evidence that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms.[153] There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms.[154][155][156] Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[157]
</p><p>The role of the gut–brain axis and the gut flora in Parkinsons became a topic of study in the 2010s, starting  with work in germ-free transgenic mice, in which fecal transplants from people with PD had worse outcomes. Some studies in humans have shown a correlation between patterns of dysbiosis in the gut flora in the people with PD, and these patterns, along with a measure of severity of constipation, could diagnose PD with a 90% specificity but only a 67% sensitivity. As of 2017 some scientists hypothesized that changes in the gut flora might be an early site of PD pathology, or might be part of the pathology.[158][159]

119,pericardial effusion body substance,"<h2>Treatment</h2><p>It depends on its severity and cause. Small ones that don’t have symptoms and are due to known causes (for example, kidney failure) require no special treatment.</p><p>For pericardial effusions due to inflammation of the sac, treating the inflammation also treats the effusion.</p><p>In that case, you may be given:</p><ul>
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like Aleve, Indocin, and Motrin
Corticosteroids, like prednisone and Solu-Medrol

Colchicine (Colcrys)
</ul><p>If a severe infection or heart impairment (cardiac tamponade) exists, the extra fluid must be drained immediately. Drainage is done in two ways:</p><p>
Pericardiocentesis: A doctor inserts a needle through the chest into the pericardial effusion. A catheter is put into the fluid, and it’s suctioned out.</p><p>
Pericardiectomy or pericardial window: A surgeon makes an incision in the chest, reaches in, and cuts away part of the pericardium. This drains the pericardial effusion and usually prevents it from coming back. The procedure requires general anesthesia and is riskier than pericardiocentesis.</p><p>Pericardial effusions that are 3 months old or older are called chronic. Often, no cause is known. They’re monitored without treatment. If there are symptoms or your heart is being harmed, drainage is usually done.</p>"
120,peripheral vascular disease,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Depending on the severity of the disease, these steps can be taken, according to these guidelines:[54]
</p><h3>Lifestyle[edit]</h3><ul>Stopping smoking (cigarettes promote PAD and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease)
Regular exercise for those with claudication helps open up alternative small vessels (collateral flow) and the limitation in walking often improves.  Treadmill exercise (35 to 50 minutes, three or four times per week[27]) has been reviewed as another treatment with a number of positive outcomes, including reduction in cardiovascular events and improved quality of life. Supervised exercise programs increase pain-free walking time and the maximum walking distance in people with PAD.</ul><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><ul>Management of diabetes
Management of hypertension
Management of high cholesterol, and antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel. Statins reduce clot formation and cholesterol levels, respectively, can help with disease progression, and address the other cardiovascular risks that the affected person is likely to have.</ul><p>According to guidelines, taking aspirin or clopidogrel, is recommended to reduce MI, stroke, and other causes of vascular death in people with symptomatic peripheral artery disease.[16] The effectiveness of both aspirin and clopidogrel, to reduce risk of cardiovascular ischemic events in people with symptomatic PAD is not well established.
</p><p>Cilostazol can improve symptoms in some.[19] Pentoxifylline is of unclear benefit.[55] Cilostazol may improve walking distance for people who experience claudication due to peripheral artery disease, but no strong evidence  suggests that it improves the quality of life, decreases mortality, or decreases the risk of cardiovascular events.[19]
</p><p>Treatment with other drugs or vitamins are unsupported by clinical evidence, ""but trials evaluating the effect of folate and vitamin B12 on hyperhomocysteinemia, a putative vascular risk factor, are near completion"".[54]
</p><h3>Revascularization[edit]</h3><p>After a trial of the best medical treatment outline above, if symptoms persist, patients may be referred to a vascular or endovascular surgeon. The benefit of revascularization is thought to correspond to the severity of ischemia and the presence of other risk factors for limb loss such as wound and infection severity.[52]
</p><ul>Angioplasty (or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty) can be done on solitary lesions in large arteries, such as the femoral artery, but may not have sustained benefits.[56] Patency rates following angioplasty are highest for iliac arteries, and decrease with arteries towards the toes. Other criteria that affect outcome following revascularization are length of lesion and number of lesions.[57][58] There does not appear to be long term advantages or sustained benefit to placing a stent following angioplasty in order to hold the narrowing of the subsartorial artery open.[59]
Atherectomy, in which the plaque is scraped off of the inside of the vessel wall (albeit with no better results than angioplasty)[60]
Vascular bypass grafting can be performed to circumvent a diseased area of the arterial vasculature. The great saphenous vein is used as a conduit if available, although artificial (Gore-Tex or PTFE) material is often used for long grafts when adequate venous conduit is unavailable.
When gangrene has set in, amputation is required to prevent infected tissues from causing sepsis, a life-threatening illness.
Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are used in cases of arterial thrombosis or embolism.</ul><h3>Guidelines[edit]</h3><p>An updated consensus guideline from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association for the diagnosis and treatment of lower extremity, renal, mesenteric, and abdominal aortic PAD was compiled in 2013, combining the 2005 and 2011 guidelines.[33]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>Research is being done on therapies to prevent progression of PAD.[63] In those who have developed critically poor blood flow to the legs, the benefit of autotransplantation of autologous mononuclear cells is unclear.[64]
</p><p>Only one randomized controlled trial has been conducted comparing vascular bypass to angioplasty for the treatment of severe PAD.[65] The trial found no difference in amputation-free survival between vascular bypass and angioplasty at the planned clinical endpoint, but the trial has been criticized as being underpowered, limiting endovascular options, and comparing inappropriate endpoints.[66] As of 2017, two randomized clinical trials are being conducted to better understand the optimal revascularization technique for severe PAD and critical limb ischemia (CLI), the BEST-CLI (Best Endovascular Versus Best Surgical Therapy for Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia) Trial, and the BASIL-2 (Bypass Versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg – 2 )Trial.
[67][68]
</p><p>In 2011, pCMV-vegf165 was registered in Russia as the first-in-class gene therapy drug for treatment of PAD, including the advanced stage of critical limb ischemia.[69][70]
</p>"
121,personality disorder,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><h3>Specific approaches[edit]</h3><p>There are many different forms (modalities) of treatment used for personality disorders:[71]
</p><ul>Individual psychotherapy has been a mainstay of treatment. There are long-term and short-term (brief) forms.
Family therapy, including couples therapy.
Group therapy for personality dysfunction is probably the second most used.
Psychological-education may be used as an addition.
Self-help groups may provide resources for personality disorders.
Psychiatric medications for treating symptoms of personality dysfunction or co-occurring conditions.
Milieu therapy, a kind of group-based residential approach, has a history of use in treating personality disorders, including therapeutic communities.
The practice of mindfulness that includes developing the ability to be nonjudgmentally aware of unpleasant emotions appears to be a promising clinical tool for managing different types of personality disorders.[72][73]</ul><p>There are different specific theories or schools of therapy within many of these modalities. They may, for example, emphasize psychodynamic techniques, or cognitive or behavioral techniques. In clinical practice, many therapists use an 'eclectic' approach, taking elements of different schools as and when they seem to fit to an individual client. There is also often a focus on common themes that seem to be beneficial regardless of techniques, including attributes of the therapist (e.g. trustworthiness, competence, caring), processes afforded to the client (e.g. ability to express and confide difficulties and emotions), and the match between the two (e.g. aiming for mutual respect, trust and boundaries).

</table><h3>Challenges[edit]</h3><p>The management and treatment of personality disorders can be a challenging and controversial area, for by definition the difficulties have been enduring and affect multiple areas of functioning. This often involves interpersonal issues, and there can be difficulties in seeking and obtaining help from organizations in the first place, as well as with establishing and maintaining a specific therapeutic relationship. On the one hand, an individual may not consider themselves to have a mental health problem, while on the other, community mental health services may view individuals with personality disorders as too complex or difficult, and may directly or indirectly exclude individuals with such diagnoses or associated behaviors.[74] The disruptiveness that people with personality disorders can create in an organisation makes these, arguably, the most challenging conditions to manage.
</p><p>Apart from all these issues, an individual may not consider their personality to be disordered or the cause of problems. This perspective may be caused by the patient's ignorance or lack of insight into their own condition, an ego-syntonic perception of the problems with their personality that prevents them from experiencing it as being in conflict with their goals and self-image, or by the simple fact that there is no distinct or objective boundary between 'normal' and 'abnormal' personalities. Unfortunately, there is substantial social stigma and discrimination related to the diagnosis.
</p><p>The term 'personality disorder' encompasses a wide range of issues, each with a different level of severity or disability; thus, personality disorders can require fundamentally different approaches and understandings. To illustrate the scope of the matter, consider that while some disorders or individuals are characterized by continual social withdrawal and the shunning of relationships, others may cause fluctuations in forwardness. The extremes are worse still: at one extreme lie self-harm and self-neglect, while at another extreme some individuals may commit violence and crime. There can be other factors such as problematic substance use or dependency or behavioral addictions. A person may meet the criteria for multiple personality disorder diagnoses and/or other mental disorders, either at particular times or continually, thus making coordinated input from multiple services a potential requirement.
</p><p>Therapists in this area can become disheartened by lack of initial progress, or by apparent progress that then leads to setbacks. Clients may be perceived as negative, rejecting, demanding, aggressive or manipulative. This has been looked at in terms of both therapist and client; in terms of social skills, coping efforts, defense mechanisms, or deliberate strategies; and in terms of moral judgments or the need to consider underlying motivations for specific behaviors or conflicts. The vulnerabilities of a client, and indeed a therapist, may become lost behind actual or apparent strength and resilience. It is commonly stated that there is always a need to maintain appropriate professional personal boundaries, while allowing for emotional expression and therapeutic relationships. However, there can be difficulty acknowledging the different worlds and views that both the client and therapist may live with. A therapist may assume that the kinds of relationships and ways of interacting that make them feel safe and comfortable have the same effect on clients. As an example of one extreme, people who may have been exposed to hostility, deceptiveness, rejection, aggression or abuse in their lives, may in some cases be made confused, intimidated or suspicious by presentations of warmth, intimacy or positivity. On the other hand, reassurance, openness and clear communication are usually helpful and needed. It can take several months of sessions, and perhaps several stops and starts, to begin to develop a trusting relationship that can meaningfully address a client's issues.[75]
</p>"
122,pneumonia,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures and appropriate treatment of other health problems.[20] It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.[22]
</p><h3>Vaccination</h3><p>Vaccination prevents against certain bacterial and viral pneumonias both in children and adults. Influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza,[11][71][needs update] The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older.[72] Immunizing health care workers decreases the risk of viral pneumonia among their people.[65]
</p><p>Vaccinations against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have good evidence to support their use.[46] There is strong evidence for vaccinating children under the age of 2 against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine).[73][74][75] Vaccinating children against Streptococcus pneumoniae has led to a decreased rate of these infections in adults, because many adults acquire infections from children. A Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine is available for adults, and has been found to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease by 74%, but there is insufficient evidence to suggest using the pneumococcal vaccine to prevent pneumonia or death in the general adult population.[76] The CDC recommends that young children and adults over the age of 65 receive the pneumococcal vaccine, as well as older children or younger adults who have an increased risk of getting pneumococcal disease.[75] The pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of community acquired pneumonia in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but does not reduce mortality or the risk of hospitalization for people with this condition.[77] People with COPD are suggested to have a pneumococcal vaccination.[77] Other vaccines for which there is support for a protective effect against pneumonia include pertussis, varicella, and measles.[78]
</p><h3>Medications</h3><p>When influenza outbreaks occur, medications such as amantadine or rimantadine may help prevent the condition; however are associated with side effects.[79] Zanamivir or oseltamivir decrease the chance that people who are exposed to the virus will develop symptoms; however, it is recommended that potential side effects are taken into account.[80]
</p><h3>Other</h3><p>Smoking cessation[57] and reducing indoor air pollution, such as that from cooking indoors with wood or dung, are both recommended.[20][22] Smoking appears to be the single biggest risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia in otherwise-healthy adults.[65] Hand hygiene and coughing into one's sleeve may also be effective preventative measures.[78] Wearing surgical masks by the sick may also prevent illness.[65]
</p><p>Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia.[22][78][81] In children less than 6 months of age, exclusive breast feeding reduces both the risk and severity of disease.[22] In those with HIV/AIDS and a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/uL the antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole decreases the risk of Pneumocystis pneumonia[82] and is also useful for prevention in those that are immunocomprised but do not have HIV.[83]
</p><p>Testing pregnant women for Group B Streptococcus and Chlamydia trachomatis, and administering antibiotic treatment, if needed, reduces rates of pneumonia in infants;[84][85] preventive measures for HIV transmission from mother to child may also be efficient.[86] Suctioning the mouth and throat of infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid has not been found to reduce the rate of aspiration pneumonia and may cause potential harm,[87] thus this practice is not recommended in the majority of situations.[87] In the frail elderly good oral health care may lower the risk of aspiration pneumonia.[88] Zinc supplementation in children 2 months to five years old appears to reduce rates of pneumonia.[89]
</p><p>For people with low levels of vitamin C in their diet or blood, taking vitamin C supplements may be suggested to decrease the risk of pneumonia, although there is no strong evidence of benefit.[90] There is insufficient evidence to recommend that the general population take vitamin C to prevent pneumonia.[90]
</p><p>For adults and children in the hospital who require a respirator, there is no strong evidence indicating a difference between heat and moisture exchangers and heated humidifiers for preventing pneumonia.[91] There is no good evidence that one approach to mouth care is better than others in preventing nursing home acquired pneumonia.[92]

</table><p>Antibiotics by mouth, rest, simple analgesics, and fluids usually suffice for complete resolution.[57] However, those with other medical conditions, the elderly, or those with significant trouble breathing may require more advanced care. If the symptoms worsen, the pneumonia does not improve with home treatment, or complications occur, hospitalization may be required.[57] Worldwide, approximately 7–13% of cases in children result in hospitalization,[20] whereas in the developed world between 22 and 42% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia are admitted.[57] The CURB-65 score is useful for determining the need for admission in adults.[57] If the score is 0 or 1, people can typically be managed at home; if it is 2, a short hospital stay or close follow-up is needed; if it is 3–5, hospitalization is recommended.[57] In children those with respiratory distress or oxygen saturations of less than 90% should be hospitalized.[93] The utility of chest physiotherapy in pneumonia has not yet been determined.[94][needs update][95] Non-invasive ventilation may be beneficial in those admitted to the intensive care unit.[96] Over-the-counter cough medicine has not been found to be effective,[97] nor has the use of zinc in children.[98] There is insufficient evidence for mucolytics.[97] There is no strong evidence to recommend that children who have non-measles related pneumonia take Vitamin A supplements.[99] For those with sepsis, 30 ml/kg of crystalloid should be infused to correct hypotension.[33] Vitamin D, as of 2018 is of unclear benefit in children.[100]
</p><h3>Bacterial</h3><p>Antibiotics improve outcomes in those with bacterial pneumonia.[12] First dose of antibiotics should be given as soon as possible.[33] Increased use of antibiotics, however, may lead to the development of antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria.[101] Antibiotic choice depends initially on the characteristics of the person affected, such as age, underlying health, and the location the infection was acquired. Antibiotic use is also associated with side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, taste distortion, or headaches.[101] In the UK, treatment before culture results with amoxicillin is recommended as the first line for community-acquired pneumonia, with doxycycline or clarithromycin as alternatives.[57] In North America, where the ""atypical"" forms of community-acquired pneumonia are more common, macrolides (such as azithromycin or erythromycin), and doxycycline have displaced amoxicillin as first-line outpatient treatment in adults.[35][102] In children with mild or moderate symptoms, amoxicillin taken by mouth remains the first line.[93][103][104] The use of fluoroquinolones in uncomplicated cases is discouraged due to concerns about side-effects and generating resistance in light of there being no greater clinical benefit.[35][105]
</p><p>For those who require hospitalization and caught their pneumonia in the community the use of a β-lactam such as cephazolin plus macrolide such as azithromycin or a fluoroquinolones is recommended.[106] Antibiotics by mouth and by injection appear to be similarly effective in children with severe pneumonia.[107]
</p><p>The duration of treatment has traditionally been seven to ten days, but increasing evidence suggests that shorter courses (3–5 days) may be effective for certain types of pneumonia and may reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.[108][109][110][111] For pneumonia that is associated with a ventilator caused by non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NF-GNB), a shorter course of antibiotics increases the risk of that pneumonia will return.[110] Recommendations for hospital-acquired pneumonia include third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin.[70] These antibiotics are often given intravenously and used in combination.[70] In those treated in hospital, more than 90% improve with the initial antibiotics.[25] For people with ventilator-acquired pneumonia, the choice of antibiotic therapy will depend on the person's risk of being infected with a strain of bacteria that is multi-drug resistant.[31] Once clinically stable, intravenous antibiotics should be swithced to oral antibiotics.[33] For those with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Legionella infections, prolonged antibiotics may be beneficial.[33]
</p><p>The addition of corticosteroids to standard antibiotic treatment appears to improve outcomes, reducing death and morbidity for adults with severe community acquired pneumonia, and reducing death for adults and children with non-severe community acquired pneumonia.[112][113] Side effects associated with the use of corticosteroids include high blood sugar.[112] They are therefore recommended in adults with severe community acquired pneumonia.[112] There is some evidence that adding corticosteroids to the standard PCP pneumonia treatment may be beneficial for people who are infected with HIV.[40]
</p><p>The use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) along with antibiotics does not appear to reduce mortality and routine use for treating pneumonia is not supported by evidence.[114]
</p><h3>Viral</h3><p>Neuraminidase inhibitors may be used to treat viral pneumonia caused by influenza viruses (influenza A and influenza B).[11] No specific antiviral medications are recommended for other types of community acquired viral pneumonias including SARS coronavirus, adenovirus, hantavirus, and parainfluenza virus.[11] Influenza A may be treated with rimantadine or amantadine, while influenza A or B may be treated with oseltamivir, zanamivir or peramivir.[11] These are of most benefit if they are started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.[11] Many strains of H5N1 influenza A, also known as avian influenza or ""bird flu"", have shown resistance to rimantadine and amantadine.[11] The use of antibiotics in viral pneumonia is recommended by some experts, as it is impossible to rule out a complicating bacterial infection.[11] The British Thoracic Society recommends that antibiotics be withheld in those with mild disease.[11] The use of corticosteroids is controversial.[11]
</p><h3>Aspiration</h3><p>In general, aspiration pneumonitis is treated conservatively with antibiotics indicated only for aspiration pneumonia.[115] The choice of antibiotic will depend on several factors, including the suspected causative organism and whether pneumonia was acquired in the community or developed in a hospital setting. Common options include clindamycin, a combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic and metronidazole, or an aminoglycoside.[116]
Corticosteroids are sometimes used in aspiration pneumonia, but there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness.[115]
</p>"
123,pneumonia aspiration,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>There have been several practices associated with decreased incidence and decreased severity of aspiration pneumonia as detailed below.
</p><h3>Oral hygiene[edit]</h3><p>Studies showed that the net reduction of oral bacteria was associated with a decrease in both incidence of aspiration pneumonia as well as mortality from aspiration pneumonia.[17] One broad method of decreasing the number of bacteria in the mouth involves the use of antimicrobials, ranging from topical antibiotics to intravenous antibiotic use.[17] Whereas the use of antibiotics focuses on destroying and hindering the growth of bacteria, mechanical removal of oral bacteria by a dental professional also plays a key role in reducing the bacterial burden.[17] By reducing the amount of bacteria in the mouth, the likelihood of infection when aspiration occurs is reduced as well.[17] For people who are critically ill that require a feeding tube, there is evidence suggesting that the risk of aspiration pneumonia may be reduced by inserting the feeding tube into the duodenum or the jejunum (post-pyloric feeding), when compared to inserting the feeding tube into the stomach (gastric feeding).[5]
</p><h3>Enhanced swallow[edit]</h3><p>Many people at risk for aspiration pneumonia have an impaired swallowing mechanism, which may increase the chance of aspiration of food particles with meals.[17] There is some evidence to indicate that training of various parts of the body involved in the act of swallowing, including the tongue and lips, may reduce episodes of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia, however further research is required to confirm this benefit.[17] Other simple actions during feeding can improve the swallowing capability of a person and thus reduce the risk of aspiration, including changes in position and feeding assistance.[18]
</p><h3>After surgery[edit]</h3><p>Many instances of aspiration occur during surgical operations, especially during anesthesia induction.[19] The administration of anesthesia causes suppression of protective reflexes, most importantly the gag reflex. As a result, stomach particles can easily enter the lungs. Certain risk factors predispose individuals to aspiration, especially conditions causing dysfunction of the upper gastrointestinal system.[19] Identifying these conditions before the operation begins is essential for proper preparation during the procedure.[19] It is recommended that patients fast prior to procedures as well.[19] Other practices that may be beneficial but have not been well-studied include medication that reduce the acidity of gastric contents and rapid sequence induction.[19]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The main treatment of aspiration pneumonia revolves around the use of antibiotics to remove the bacteria causing the infection.[1] Broad antibiotic coverage is required to account for the diverse types of bacteria possibly causing the infection.[1] Currently recommended antibiotics include clindamycin, meropenem, ertapenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, and moxifloxacin.[1] If there is a large accumulation of fluid within the lungs, drainage of the fluid may also aid in the healing process.[9]
</p>"
124,pneumothorax,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatment of pneumothorax depends on a number of factors, and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of a chest tube. Treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms and indicators of acute illness, the presence of underlying lung disease, the estimated size of the pneumothorax on X-ray, and – in some instances – on the personal preference of the person involved.[13]
</p><p>In traumatic pneumothorax, chest tubes are usually inserted. If mechanical ventilation is required, the risk of tension pneumothorax is greatly increased and the insertion of a chest tube is mandatory.[12][34] Any open chest wound should be covered with an airtight seal, as it carries a high risk of leading to tension pneumothorax. Ideally, a dressing called the ""Asherman seal"" should be utilized, as it appears to be more effective than a standard ""three-sided"" dressing. The Asherman seal is a specially designed device that adheres to the chest wall and, through a valve-like mechanism, allows air to escape but not to enter the chest.[35]
</p><p>Tension pneumothorax is usually treated with urgent needle decompression. This may be required before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional.[14][35] The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted.[14][35] If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.[36]
</p><h3>Conservative[edit]</h3><p>Small spontaneous pneumothoraces do not always require treatment, as they are unlikely to proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease.[17][27] It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited.[13] Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below).[13] Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks.[13] There is, however, no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.[37]
</p><p>Secondary pneumothoraces are only treated conservatively if the size is very small (1 cm or less air rim) and there are limited symptoms. Admission to the hospital is usually recommended. Oxygen given at a high flow rate may accelerate resorption as much as fourfold.[13][38]
</p><h3>Aspiration[edit]</h3><p>In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP associated with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as the insertion of a chest tube. This involves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5 liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction in the size of the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases.[11][13][17] Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.[39]
</p><p>Aspiration may also be considered in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2 cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure.[13] American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – even those due to PSP – should be treated with a chest tube.[27] Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.[12]
</p><h3>Chest tube[edit]</h3><div> A chest tube placed on the right for a pneumothorax</div><p>A chest tube (or intercostal drain) is the most definitive initial treatment of a pneumothorax. These are typically inserted in an area under the axilla (armpit) called the ""safe triangle"", where damage to internal organs can be avoided; this is delineated by a horizontal line at the level of the nipple and two muscles of the chest wall (latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major). Local anesthetic is applied. Two types of tubes may be used. In spontaneous pneumothorax, small-bore (smaller than 14 F, 4.7 mm diameter) tubes may be inserted by the Seldinger technique, and larger tubes do not have an advantage.[13][40] In traumatic pneumothorax, larger tubes (28 F, 9.3 mm) are used.[35]
</p><p>Chest tubes are required in PSPs that have not responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema (""re-expansion pulmonary edema""). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it for a period of time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.[13][17][27]
</p><p>If after 2–4 days there is still evidence of an air leak, various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20 cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; it is thought that this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.[13]
</p><p>Chest tubes are used first-line when pneumothorax occurs in people with AIDS, usually due to underlying pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), as this condition is associated with prolonged air leakage. Bilateral pneumothorax (pneumothorax on both sides) is relatively common in people with pneumocystis pneumonia, and surgery is often required.[13]
</p><p>It is possible for a person with a chest tube to be managed in an ambulatory care setting by using a Heimlich valve, although research to demonstrate the equivalence to hospitalization has been of limited quality.[41]
</p><h3>Pleurodesis and surgery[edit]</h3><p>Pleurodesis is a procedure that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results in the short term are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%.[11][13] Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.
</p><div> Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection</div><p>A less invasive approach is thoracoscopy, usually in the form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin.[11][13] Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery.[13] VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.[11][13]
</p><p>If a chest tube is already in place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve chemical pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, minocycline or doxycycline. Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than when using surgical approaches,[11][13] but talc pleurodesis has been found to have few negative long-term consequences in younger people.[11]
</p><h3>Aftercare[edit]</h3><p>If pneumothorax occurs in a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation.[13] It may be advisable for someone to remain off work for up to a week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.[42]
</p><p>Air travel is discouraged for up to seven days after complete resolution of a pneumothorax if recurrence does not occur.[13] Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventative procedure has been performed. Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that lung function tests and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed.[13][27] Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.[13]
</p><h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>A preventative procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended after an episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US.[11] Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation of the risk of recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax.[43] Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides (""bilateral""), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.[13]

125,primary carcinoma of the liver cells,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Since hepatitis B and C are some of the main causes of hepatocellular carcinoma, prevention of infection is key to then prevent HCC. Thus, childhood vaccination against hepatitis B may reduce the risk of liver cancer in the future.[39]  In the case of patients with cirrhosis, alcohol consumption is to be avoided. Also, screening for hemochromatosis may be beneficial for some patients.[40]
Whether screening those with chronic liver disease for HCC improves outcomes is unclear.[41]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma varies by the stage of disease, a person's likelihood to tolerate surgery, and availability of liver transplant:
</p><ol>Curative intention: for limited disease, when the cancer is limited to one or more areas of within the liver, surgically removing the malignant cells may be curative. This may be accomplished by resection the affected portion of the liver (partial hepatectomy) or in some cases by orthotopic liver transplantation of the entire organ.
""Bridging"" intention: for limited disease which qualifies for potential liver transplantation, the person may undergo targeted treatment of some or all of the known tumor while waiting for a donor organ to become available.[42]
""Downstaging"" intention: for moderately advanced disease which has not spread beyond the liver, but is too advanced to qualify for curative treatment. The person may be treated by targeted therapies in order to reduce the size or number of active tumors, with the goal of once again qualifying for liver transplant after this treatment.[42]
Palliative intention: for more advanced disease, including spread of cancer beyond the liver or in persons who may not tolerate surgery, treatment intended to decrease symptoms of disease and maximize duration of survival.</ol><p>Loco-regional therapy (also referred to as liver-directed therapy) refers to any one of several minimally-invasive treatment techniques to focally target HCC within the liver. These procedures are alternatives to surgery, and may be considered in combination with other strategies, such as a later liver transplantation.[43] Generally, these treatment procedures are performed by interventional radiologists or surgeons, in coordination with a medical oncologist. Loco-regional therapy may refer to either percutaneous therapies (e.g. cryoablation), or arterial catheter-based therapies (chemoembolization or radioembolization).
</p><h3>Surgical resection[edit]</h3><div> Gross anatomy of hepatocellular carcinoma</div><p>Surgical removal of the tumor is associated with better cancer prognosis, but only 10-15% of patients are suitable for surgical resection due to the extent of disease or poor liver function.[medical citation needed] Surgery is only considered if the entire tumor can be safely removed while preserving sufficient functional liver to maintain normal physiology. Thus, preoperative imaging assessment is critical  to determine both the extent of HCC and to estimate the amount of residual liver remaining after surgery. To maintain liver function, residual liver volume should exceed 25% of total liver volume in a noncirrhotic liver, greater than 40% in a cirrhotic liver.[44] Surgery on diseased or cirrhotic livers is generally associated with higher morbidity and mortality. The overall recurrence rate after resection is 50-60%. The Singapore Liver Cancer Recurrence  score can be used to estimate risk of recurrence after surgery.[45]
</p><h3>Liver transplantation[edit]</h3><p>Liver transplantation, replacing the diseased liver with a cadaveric or a living donor liver, plays an increasing role in treatment of HCC. Although outcomes following liver transplant were initially poor (20%-36% survival rate[medical citation needed]), outcomes have significantly improved with improvement in surgical techniques and adoption of the Milan criteria at US transplantation centers. Expanded Shanghai criteria in China have resulted in overall survival and disease-free survival rates similar to those achieved using the Milan criteria.[46] Studies from the late 2000s obtained higher survival rates ranging from 67% to 91%.[47]
</p><p>The risks of liver transplantation extend beyond risk of the procedure itself. The immunosuppressive medication  required after surgery to prevent rejection of the donor liver also impairs the body's natural ability to combat dysfunctional cells. If the tumor has spread undetected outside the liver before the transplant, the medication effectively increases the rate of disease progression and decreases survival. With this in mind, liver transplant ""can be a curative approach for patients with advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis"".[48] Patient selection is considered a major key for success.[49]
</p><h3>Ablation[edit]</h3><ul>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses high-frequency radio waves to destroy tumor by local heating. The electrodes are inserted into the liver tumor under ultrasound image guidance using percutaneous, laparoscopic or open surgical approach. It is suitable for small tumors (<5 cm). RFA has the best outcomes in patients with a solitary tumor less than 4 cm.[50] Since it is a local treatment and has minimal effect on normal healthy tissue, it can be repeated multiple times. Survival is better for those with smaller tumors. In one study, In one series of 302 patients, the three-year survival rates for lesions >5 cm, 2.1 to 5 cm, and ≤2 cm were 59, 74, and 91%, respectively.[51] A large randomized trial comparing surgical resection and RFA for small HCC showed similar four-year survival and less morbidities for patients treated with RFA.[52]
Cryoablation is a technique used to destroy tissue using cold temperature. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with unresectable liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. Cryosurgery involves the placement of a stainless steel probe into the center of the tumor. Liquid nitrogen is circulated through the end of this device. The tumor and a half inch margin of normal liver are frozen to -190 °C for 15 minutes, which is lethal to all tissues. The area is thawed for 10 minutes and then refrozen to -190 °C for another 15 minutes. After the tumor has thawed, the probe is removed, bleeding is controlled, and the procedure is complete. The patient  spends the first postoperative night in the intensive care unit and typically is discharged in 3–5 days. Proper selection of patients and attention to detail in performing the cryosurgical procedure are mandatory to achieve good results and outcomes. Frequently, cryosurgery is used in conjunction with liver resection, as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with cryosurgery.
Percutaneous ethanol injection is well tolerated, with high RR in small (<3 cm) solitary tumors; as of 2005, no randomized trial has comparing resection to percutaneous treatments; recurrence rates are similar to those for postresection. However, a comparative study found that local therapy can achieve a 5-year survival rate  around 60% for patients with small HCC.[53]</ul><h3>Arterial catheter-based treatment[edit]</h3><ul>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is performed for unresectable tumors or as a temporary treatment while waiting for liver transplant (""bridge to transplant""). TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure is to restrict the tumor’s vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE has been shown to increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists.[54] As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression, but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit is seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of vascular invasion, and smallest tumors. TACE is not suitable for big tumors (>8 cm), the presence of portal vein thrombus, tumors with a portal-systemic shunt, and patients with poor liver function.
Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) can be used to destroy the tumor from within (thus minimizing exposure to healthy tissue). Similar to TACE, this is a procedure in which an interventional radiologist selectively injects the artery or arteries supplying the tumor with a chemotherapeutic agent. The agent is typically Yttrium-90 (Y-90) incorporated into embolic microspheres that lodge in the tumor vasculature, causing ischemia and delivering their radiation dose directly to the lesion. This technique allows for a higher, local dose of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor while sparing normal healthy tissue. While not curative, patients have increased survival. No studies have been done to compare whether SIRT is superior to TACE in terms of survival outcomes, although retrospective studies suggest similar efficacy.[55] Two products are available, SIR-Spheres and TheraSphere. The latter is an FDA-approved treatment for primary liver cancer (HCC) which has been shown in clinical trials to increase the survival rate of low-risk patients. SIR-Spheres are FDA-approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, but outside the US, SIR-Spheres are approved for the treatment of any nonresectable liver cancer including primary liver cancer.</ul><h3>Systemic[edit]</h3><p>In disease which has spread beyond the liver, systemic therapy may be a consideration. In 2007, Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, was the first systemic agent approved for first-line treatment of advanced HCC.[56] Trials have found modest improvement in overall survival: 10.7 months vs 7.9 months and 6.5 months vs 4.2 months.[57][56]
</p><p>The most common side effects of Sorafenib include a hand-foot skin reaction and diarrhea.[57] Sorafenib is thought to work by blocking growth of both tumor cells and new blood vessels. Numerous other molecular targeted drugs are being tested as alternative first- and second-line treatments for advanced HCC.[58]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><ul>Portal Vein Embolization (PVE): This technique is sometimes used to increase the volume of healthy liver, in order to improve chances of survival following surgical removal of diseased liver. For example, embolization of the right main portal vein would result in compensatory hypertrophy of the left lobe, which may qualify the patient for a partial hepatectomy. Embolization is performed by an interventional radiologist using a percutaneous transhepatic approach. This procedure can also serve as a bridge to transplant.[59]
High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) (as opposed to diagnostic ultrasound) is an experimental technique which uses high-powered ultrasound waves to destroy tumor tissue.
A systematic review assessed 12 articles involving a total of 318 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with Yttrium-90 radioembolization.[60] Excluding a study of only one patient, post-treatment CT evaluation of the tumor showed a response ranging from 29 to 100% of patients evaluated, with all but two studies showing a response of 71% or greater.</ul><h2>Research[edit]</h2><h3>Preclinical[edit]</h3><p>Current research includes the search for the genes that are disregulated in HCC, antiheparanase antibodies,[68] protein markers,[69] non-coding RNAs[70] (such as TUC338)[71] and other predictive biomarkers.[72][73] As similar research is yielding results in various other malignant diseases, it is hoped that identifying the aberrant genes and the resultant proteins could lead to the identification of pharmacological interventions for HCC.[74]
</p><p>The development of three-dimensional culture methods provides a new approach for preclinical studies of cancer therapy using patient-derived organoids. These miniaturized organoid  'avatars'  of a patient's tumor recapitulate several features of the original tumor, rendering them an attractive model for drug-sensitivity testing and precision medicine for HCC and other types of primary liver cancer.[75]
</p><p>Furthermore, HCC occurs in patients with liver disease. A biomarker named six-miRNA signature allows effective treatment of patients with HCC and is able to predict its recurrence in the liver.[76]
</p><h3>Clinical[edit]</h3><p>JX-594, an oncolytic virus, has orphan drug designation for this condition and is undergoing clinical trials.[77]
</p><p>Hepcortespenlisimut-L (Hepko-V5), an oral cancer vaccine, also has US FDA orphan drug designation for HCC.[78] Immunitor Inc. completed a Phase II trial, published in 2017.[79]
</p><p>A randomized trial of people with advanced HCC showed no benefit for the combination of everolimus and pasireotide.[80]

126,primary malignant neoplasm,"How malignant brain tumours are treated?

A primary malignant brain tumour needs to be treated as soon as possible, because it can spread and damage other parts of the brain and spinal cord.

Surgery will usually need to be carried out to remove as much of the tumour as possible. This may be followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy to kill any cancerous cells left behind and reduce the chances of the tumour regrowing.

However, malignant tumours will often eventually return after treatment. If this happens, or if you have a secondary tumour, a cure isn't usually possible and treatment can instead be used to improve symptoms and prolong life.

127,psychotic disorder,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>The evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent psychosis appeared inconclusive.[104] But psychosis caused by drugs can be prevented.[105] Whilst early intervention in those with a psychotic episode might improve short term outcomes, little benefit was seen from these measures after five years.[106] However, there is evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may reduce the risk of  becoming psychotic in those at high risk,[107] and in 2014 the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended preventive CBT for people at risk of psychosis.[108][109]
</p><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>The treatment of psychosis depends on the specific diagnosis (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or substance intoxication). The first-line treatment for many psychotic disorders is antipsychotic medication,[110] which can reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days.
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>The choice of which antipsychotic to use is based on benefits, risks, and costs.[106] It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better.[111][112] Tentative evidence supports that amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine may be more effective for positive symptoms but result in more side effects.[113] Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages.[114] There is a good response in 40–50%, a partial response in 30–40%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics) in 20% of people.[115] Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs (""treatment-resistant"" or ""refractory"" schizophrenia),[116] but it has the potentially serious side effect of agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.[106][117][118]
</p><p>Most people on antipsychotics get side effects. People on typical antipsychotics tend to have a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain.[113] Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol.[113]
</p><h3>Counseling[edit]</h3><p>Psychological treatments such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) are possibly useful in the treatment of psychosis, helping people to focus more on what they can do in terms of valued life directions despite challenging symptomology.[119]
</p><h3>Early intervention[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Early intervention in psychosis</div><p>Early intervention in psychosis is based on the observation that identifying and treating someone in the early stages of a psychosis can improve their longer term outcome.[120] This approach advocates the use of an intensive multi-disciplinary approach during what is known as the critical period, where intervention is the most effective, and prevents the long term morbidity associated with chronic psychotic illness.
</p>"
128,pyelonephritis,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>In people who experience recurrent urinary tract infections, additional investigations may identify an underlying abnormality. Occasionally, surgical intervention is necessary to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. If no abnormality is identified, some studies suggest long-term preventive treatment with antibiotics, either daily or after sexual activity.[25] In children at risk for recurrent urinary tract infections, not enough studies have been performed to conclude prescription of long-term antibiotics have a net positive benefit.[26] Drinking cranberry juice does not appear to provide much if any benefit in decreasing urinary tract infections.[27]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>In people suspected of having pyelonephritis, a urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity test is performed, so therapy can eventually be tailored on the basis of the infecting organism.[5] As most cases of pyelonephritis are due to bacterial infections, antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment.[5] The choice of antibiotic depends on the species and antibiotic sensitivity profile of the infecting organism, and may include fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, either alone or in combination.[14]
</p><h3>Simple[edit]</h3><p>In people who do not require hospitalization and live in an area where there is a low prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a fluoroquinolone by mouth such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin is an appropriate initial choice for therapy.[5] In areas where there is a higher prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance, it is useful to initiate treatment with a single intravenous dose of a long-acting antibiotic such as ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside, and then continuing treatment with a fluoroquinolone. Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an appropriate choice for therapy if the bacteria is known to be susceptible.[5] If trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is used when the susceptibility is not known, it is useful to initiate treatment with a single intravenous dose of a long-acting antibiotic such as ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside. Oral beta-lactam antibiotics are less effective than other available agents for treatment of pyelonephritis.[14] Improvement is expected in 48 to 72 hours.[5]
</p><h3>Complicated[edit]</h3><p>People with acute pyelonephritis that is accompanied by high fever and leukocytosis are typically admitted to the hospital for intravenous hydration and intravenous antibiotic treatment. Treatment is typically initiated with an intravenous fluoroquinolone, an aminoglycoside, an extended-spectrum penicillin or cephalosporin, or a carbapenem. Combination antibiotic therapy is often used in such situations. The treatment regimen is selected based on local resistance data and the susceptibility profile of the specific infecting organism(s).[14]
</p><p>During the course of antibiotic treatment, serial white blood cell count and temperature are closely monitored. Typically, the intravenous antibiotics are continued until the person has no fever for at least 24 to 48 hours, then equivalent antibiotics by mouth can be given for a total of 2–week duration of treatment.[28] Intravenous fluids may be administered to compensate for the reduced oral intake, insensible losses (due to the raised temperature) and vasodilation and to optimize urine output. Percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral stent placement may be indicated to relieve obstruction caused by a stone. Children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics (cefixime, ceftibuten and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses (2 to 4 days) of intravenous therapy followed by oral therapy.[29] If intravenous therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective.[29]
</p><p>Treatment of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis involves antibiotics as well as surgery. Removal of the kidney is the best surgical treatment in the overwhelming majority of cases, although polar resection (partial nephrectomy) has been effective for some people with localized disease.[9][30] Watchful waiting with serial imaging may be appropriate in rare circumstances.[31]
</p>"
129,respiratory failure,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><div> Mechanical ventilator</div><p>Treatment of the underlying cause is required. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are required in cases of severe respiratory failure (PaO2 less than 50 mmHg). Respiratory stimulants such as doxapram are rarely used, and if the respiratory failure resulted from an overdose of sedative drugs such as opioids or benzodiazepines, then the appropriate antidote (naloxone or flumazenil, respectively) will be given.
</p><p>There is tentative evidence that in those with respiratory failure identified before arrival in hospital, continuous positive airway pressure can be useful when started before conveying to hospital.[3]
</p>"
130,schizophrenia,"<h2>Prevention</h2><p>Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[134] There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia.[135] There is some evidence that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short-term outcomes, but there is little benefit from these measures after five years.[9] Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended.[136] Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year[137] and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).[138] Another preventative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.[14]
</p><h2>Management</h2><div>Main article: Management of schizophrenia</div><p>The primary treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often in combination with psychological and social supports.[9] Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs.[16] Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment[139] and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.[140] As of 2015 it is unclear if transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is useful for schizophrenia.[141]
</p><h3>Medication</h3><div> Risperidone (trade name Risperdal) is a common atypical antipsychotic medication.</div><p>The first-line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication,[142] which can reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. Antipsychotics fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction.[38][143] In those on antipsychotics, continued use decreases the risk of relapse.[144][145] There is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years.[145] Use of anti-psychotics can lead to dopamine hypersensitivity increasing the risk of symptoms if antipsychotics are stopped.[146]
</p><p>The choice of which antipsychotic to use is based on benefits, risks, and costs.[9] It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better.[15][147] Amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine may be more effective but are associated with greater side effects.[148] Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages.[149] There is a good response in 40–50%, a partial response in 30–40%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics) in 20% of people.[38] Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs (""treatment-resistant"" or ""refractory"" schizophrenia),[150] but it has the potentially serious side effect of agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.[9][14][151]
</p><p>Most people on antipsychotics have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics tend to have a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects; some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome. This is most pronounced with olanzapine; risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain.[148] Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol.[148] It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.[152]
</p><p>For people who are unwilling or unable to take medication regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control.[153] They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications.[144] When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment.[153] The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.[145]
</p><h3>Psychosocial</h3><p>A number of psychosocial interventions may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia including: family therapy,[154] assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive remediation,[155] skills training, token economic interventions, and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management.[156] Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family of a patient, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations.[154] Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal.[157][158] Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with some reviews finding benefit and another not.[159][160][161] Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.[162][163]
</p><h2>Research directions</h2><div>See also: Animal models of schizophrenia</div><p>Research has found a tentative benefit in using minocycline to treat schizophrenia.[223] Nidotherapy or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function, is also being studied but there is not enough evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness.[224] Negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area.[225] There have been trials on drugs with anti-inflammatory activity, based on the premise that inflammation might play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia.[226]

131,sepsis (invertebrate),"<h2>In research</h2><p>For many centuries, invertebrates were neglected by biologists, in favor of big vertebrates and ""useful"" or charismatic species.[58] Invertebrate biology was not a major field of study until the work of Linnaeus and Lamarck in the 18th century.[58] During the 20th century, invertebrate zoology became one of the major fields of natural sciences, with prominent discoveries in the fields of medicine, genetics, palaeontology, and ecology.[58] The study of invertebrates has also benefited law enforcement, as arthropods, and especially insects, were discovered to be a source of information for forensic investigators.[38]
</p><p>Two of the most commonly studied model organisms nowadays are invertebrates: the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. They have long been the most intensively studied model organisms, and were among the first life-forms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genomes, but many genes, introns, and linkages have been lost. Analysis of the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasised the importance of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to animals.[59] Invertebrates are also used by scientists in the field of aquatic biomonitoring to evaluate the effects of water pollution and climate change.[60]
</p>"
132,septicemia,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Early recognition and focused management may improve the outcomes in sepsis. Current professional recommendations include a number of actions (""bundles"") to be followed as soon as possible after diagnosis. Within the first three hours someone with sepsis should have received antibiotics and, intravenous fluids if there is evidence of either low blood pressure or other evidence for inadequate blood supply to organs (as evidenced by a raised level of lactate); blood cultures also should be obtained within this time period. After six hours the blood pressure should be adequate, close monitoring of blood pressure and blood supply to organs should be in place, and the lactate should be measured again if initially, it was raised.[8] A related bundle, the ""Sepsis Six"", is in widespread use in the United Kingdom; this requires the administration of antibiotics within an hour of recognition, blood cultures, lactate and hemoglobin determination, urine output monitoring, high-flow oxygen, and intravenous fluids.[47][48]
</p><p>Apart from the timely administration of fluids and antibiotics, the management of sepsis also involves surgical drainage of infected fluid collections and appropriate support for organ dysfunction. This may include hemodialysis in kidney failure, mechanical ventilation in lung dysfunction, transfusion of blood products, and drug and fluid therapy for circulatory failure. Ensuring adequate nutrition—preferably by enteral feeding, but if necessary, by parenteral nutrition—is important during prolonged illness.[8] Medication to prevent deep vein thrombosis and gastric ulcers also may be used.[8]
</p><h3>Antibiotics[edit]</h3><p>Two sets of blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) should be taken without delaying the initiation of antibiotics. Cultures from other sites such as respiratory secretions, urine, wounds, cerebrospinal fluid, and catheter insertion sites (in-situ more than 48 hours) can be taken if infections from these sites are suspected.[5] In severe sepsis and septic shock, broad-spectrum antibiotics (usually two, a β-lactam antibiotic with broad coverage, or broad-spectrum carbapenem combined with fluoroquinolones, macrolides, or aminoglycosides) are recommended. However, combination of antibiotics is not recommended for the treatment of sepsis but without shock and immunocompromised persons unless the combination is used to broaden the anti-bacterial activity. The choice of antibiotics is important in determining the survival of the person.[46][5] Some recommend they be given within one hour of making the diagnosis, stating that for every hour of delay in the administration of antibiotics, there is an associated 6% rise in mortality.[25][46] Others did not find a benefit with early administration.[49]
</p><p>Several factors determine the most appropriate choice for the initial antibiotic regimen. These factors include local patterns of bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics, whether the infection is thought to be a hospital or community-acquired infection, and which organ systems are thought to be infected.[46] Antibiotic regimens should be reassessed daily and narrowed if appropriate. Treatment duration is typically 7–10 days with the type of antibiotic used directed by the results of cultures. If the culture result is negative, antibiotics should be de-escalated according to person's clinical response or stopped altogether if infection is not present to decrease the chances that the person is infected with multiple drug resistance organisms. In case of people having high risk of being infected with multiple drug resistance organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, addition of antibiotic specific to gram-negative organism is recommended. For Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin or teicoplanin is recommended. For Legionella infection, addition of macrolide or fluoroquinolone is chosen. If fungal infection is suspected, an echinocandin, such as caspofungin or micafungin, is chosen for people with severe sepsis, followed by triazole (fluconazole and itraconazole) for less ill people.[5] Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in people who has SIRS without any infectious origin such as acute pancreatitis and burns unless sepsis is suspected.[5]
</p><p>Once daily dosing of aminoglycoside is sufficient to achieve peak plasma concentration for clinical response without kidney toxicity. Meanwhile, for antibiotics with low volume distribution (vancomycin, teicoplanin, colistin), loading dose is required to achieve adequate therapeutic level to fight infections. Frequent infusions of beta-lactam antibiotics without exceeding total daily dose would help to keep the antibiotics level above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), thus providing better clinical response.[5] Giving beta-lactam antibiotics continuously may be better than giving them intermittently.[50] Access to therapeutic drug monitoring is important to ensure adequate drug therapeutic level while at the same time preventing the drug from reaching toxic level.[5]
</p><h3>Intravenous fluids[edit]</h3><p>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign has recommended 30 ml/kg of fluid to be given in adults in the first 3 hours followed by fluid titration according to blood pressure, urine output, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg.[5] In children an initial amount of 20ml/kg is reasonable in shock.[51] In cases of severe sepsis and septic shock where a central venous catheter is used to measure blood pressures dynamically, fluids should be administered until the central venous pressure (CVP) reaches 8–12mmHg.[45] Once these goals are met, the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), i.e., the oxygen saturation of venous blood as it returns to the heart as measured at the vena cava, is optimized.[5] If the ScvO2 is less than 70%, blood may be given to reach a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL and then inotropes are added until the ScvO2 is optimized.[35] In those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sufficient tissue blood fluid, more fluids should be given carefully.[8]
</p><p>Crystalloid is recommended as the fluid of choice for resuscitation.[5] Albumin can be used if large amount of crystalloid is required for resuscitaition.[5] Crystalloid solutions shows little difference with hydroxyethyl starch in terms of risk of death.[52] Starches also carry an increased risk of acute kidney injury,[52][53] and need for blood transfusion.[54][55] Various colloid solutions (such as modified gelatin) carry no advantage over crystalloid.[52] Albumin also appears to be of no benefit over crystalloids.[56]
</p><h3>Blood products[edit]</h3><p>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended packed red blood cells transfusion for hemoglobin levels below 70 g/L if there is no myocardial ischemia, hypoxemia, or acute bleeding.[5] In a 2014 trial, blood transfusions to keep target hemoglobin above 70 or 90 g/L did not make any difference to survival rates; meanwhile, those with a lower threshold of transfusion received fewer transfusions in total.[57] Erythropoietin is not recommended in the treatment of anemia with septic shock because it may precipitate blood clotting events. Fresh frozen plasma transfusion usually does not correct the underlying clotting abnormalities before a planned surgical procedure. However, platelet transfusion is suggested for platelet counts below (10 × 109/L) without any risk of bleeding, or (20 × 109/L) with high risk of bleeding, or (50 × 109/L) with active bleeding, before a planned surgery or an invasive procedure.[5] IV immunoglobulin is not recommended because its beneficial effects are uncertain.[5] Monoclonal and polyclonal preparations of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) do not lower the rate of death in newborns and adults with sepsis.[58] Evidence for the use of IgM-enriched polyclonal preparations of IVIG is inconsistent.[58] On the other hand, the use of antithrombin to treat disseminated intravascular coagulation is also not useful. Meanwhile, the blood purification technique (such as hemoperfusion, plasma filtration, and coupled plasma filtration adsorption) to remove inflammatory mediators and bacterial toxins from the blood also does not demonstrate any survival benefit for septic shock.[5]
</p><h3>Vasopressors[edit]</h3><p>If the person has been sufficiently fluid resuscitated but the mean arterial pressure is not greater than 65 mmHg, vasopressors are recommended.[5] Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) is recommended as the initial choice.[5]
</p><p>Norepinephrine is often used as a first-line treatment for hypotensive septic shock because evidence shows that there is a relative deficiency of vasopressin, when shock continues for 24 to 48 hours.[59]  Norepinephrine raises blood pressure through a vasoconstriction effect, with little effect on stroke volume and heart rate.[5] In some people, the required dose of vasopressor needed to increase the mean arterial pressure can become exceedingly high that it becomes toxic.[60]  In order to reduce the required dose of vasopressor, epinephrine may be added.[60] Epinephrine is not often used as a first-line treatment for hypotensive shock because it reduces blood flow to the abdominal organs and increases lactate levels.[59] However, one of the adrenaline side effects is that it reduces blood flow to abdominal organs and may cause increased lactate levels. Vasopressin can be used in septic shock because studies have shown that there is a relative deficiency of vasopressin when shock continues for 24 to 48 hours. However, vasopressin reduces blood flow to the heart, finger/toes, and abdominal organs, resulting in a lack of oxygen supply to these tissues.[5] Dopamine is typically not recommended. Although dopamine is useful to increase the stroke volume of the heart, it causes more abnormal heart rhythms than norepinephrine and also has an immunosuppressive effect. Dopamine is not proven to have protective properties on the kidneys.[5] Dobutamine can also be used in hypotensive septic shock to increase cardiac output and correct blood flow to the tissues.[61] Dobutamine is not used as often as epinephrine due to its associate side effects, which include reducing blood flow to the gut.[61] Additionally, dobutamine increases the cardiac output by abnormally increasing the heart rate.[61]
</p><h3>Steroids[edit]</h3><p>The use of steroids in sepsis is controversial.[9] Studies do not give a clear picture as to whether and when glucocorticoids should be used.[62] The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against their use in those with septic shock if intravenous fluids and vasopressors are able to stabilize the person's cardiovascular function. Low dose hydrocortisone is only used if both intravenous fluids and vasopressors are not able to adequately treat septic shock.[5] A 2015 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence of benefit,[63] as did a 2019 review in JAMA.[64]
</p><p>During critical illness, a state of adrenal insufficiency and tissue resistance to corticosteroids may occur. This has been termed critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency.[65] Treatment with corticosteroids might be most beneficial in those with septic shock and early severe ARDS, whereas its role in others such as those with pancreatitis or severe pneumonia is unclear.[65] However, the exact way of determining corticosteroid insufficiency remains problematic. It should be suspected in those poorly responding to resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors. Neither ACTH stimulation testing[65] nor random cortisol levels are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.[5] The method of stopping glucocorticoid drugs is variable, and it is unclear whether they should be slowly decreased or simply abruptly stopped. However, the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended to taper steroids when vasopressors are no longer needed.[5]
</p><h3>Anesthesia[edit]</h3><p>A target tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) and a plateau pressure less than 30 cm H2O is recommended for those who require ventilation due to sepsis-induced severe ARDS. High positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is recommended for moderate to severe ARDS in sepsis as it opens more lung units for oxygen exchange. Predicted body weight is calculated based on sex and height, and tools for this are available.[66] Recruitment maneuvers may be necessary for severe ARDS by briefly raising the transpulmonary pressure. It is recommended that the head of the bed be raised if possible to improve ventilation. However, β2 adrenergic receptor agonists are not recommended to treat ARDS because it may reduce survival rates and precipitate abnormal heart rhythms. A spontaneous breathing trial using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), T piece, or inspiratory pressure augmentation can be helpful in reducing the duration of ventilation. Minimizing intermittent or continuous sedation is helpful in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation.[5]
</p><p>General anesthesia is recommended for people with sepsis who require surgical procedures to remove the infective source. Usually inhalational and intravenous anesthetics are used. Requirements for anesthetics may be reduced in sepsis. Inhalational anesthetics can reduce the level of proinflammatory cytokines, altering leukocyte adhesion and proliferation, inducing apoptosis (cell death) of the lymphocytes, possibly with a toxic effect on mitochondrial function.[42] Although etomidate has a minimal effect on the cardiovascular system, it is often not recommended as a medication to help with intubation in this situation due to concerns it may lead to poor adrenal function and an increased risk of death.[67][68] The small amount of evidence there is, however, has not found a change in the risk of death with etomidate.[69]
</p><p>Paralytic agents are not suggested for use in sepsis cases in the absence of ARDS, as a growing body of evidence points to reduced durations of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stays.[70] However, paralytic use in ARDS cases remains controversial. When appropriately used, paralytics may aid successful mechanical ventilation, however evidence has also suggested that mechanical ventilation in severe sepsis does not improve oxygen consumption and delivery.[70]
</p><h3>Early goal directed therapy[edit]</h3><p>Early goal directed therapy (EGDT) is an approach to the management of severe sepsis during the initial 6 hours after diagnosis.[71] It is a step-wise approach, with the physiologic goal of optimizing cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility.[72] It includes giving early antibiotics.[72] EGDT also involves monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and specific interventions to achieve key resuscitation targets which include maintaining a central venous pressure between 8–12 mmHg, a mean arterial pressure of between 65–90 mmHg, a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) greater than 70% and a urine output of greater than 0.5 ml/kg/hour. The goal is to optimize oxygen delivery to tissues and achieve a balance between systemic oxygen delivery and demand.[72] An appropriate decrease in serum lactate may be equivalent to ScvO2 and easier to obtain.[73]
</p><p>In the original trial, early goal directed therapy was found to reduce mortality from 46.5% to 30.5% in those with sepsis,[72] and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign has been recommending its use.[8] However, three more recent large randomized control trials (ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe), did not demonstrate a 90-day mortality benefit of early goal directed therapy when compared to standard therapy in severe sepsis.[74] It is likely that some parts of EGDT are more important than others.[74] Following these trials the use of EGDT is still considered reasonable.[75]
</p><h3>Newborns[edit]</h3><p>Neonatal sepsis can be difficult to diagnose as newborns may be asymptomatic.[76] If a newborn shows signs and symptoms suggestive of sepsis, antibiotics are immediately started and are either changed to target a specific organism identified by diagnostic testing or discontinued after an infectious cause for the symptoms has been ruled out.[77] Despite early intervention, death occurs in 13% of children who develop septic shock, with the risk partly based on other health problems. Those without multiple organ system failure or who require only one inotropic agent mortality is low.[78]
</p><h3>Other[edit]</h3><p>Treating fever in sepsis, including people in septic shock, has not been associated with any improvement in mortality over a period of 28 days.[79] Treatment of fever still occurs for other reasons.[80][81]
</p><p>A 2012 Cochrane review concluded that N-acetylcysteine does not reduce mortality in those with SIRS or sepsis and may even be harmful.[82]
</p><p>Recombinant activated protein C (drotrecogin alpha) was originally introduced for severe sepsis (as identified by a high APACHE II score), where it was thought to confer a survival benefit.[71] However, subsequent studies showed that it increased adverse events—bleeding risk in particular—and did not decrease mortality.[10] It was removed from sale in 2011.[10] Another medication known as eritoran also has not shown benefit.[83]
</p><p>In those with high blood sugar levels, insulin to bring it down to 7.8–10 mmol/L (140–180 mg/dL) is recommended with lower levels potentially worsening outcomes.[84] Glucose levels taken from capillary blood should be interpreted with care because such measurements may not be accurate. If a person has an arterial catheter, arterial blood is recommended for blood glucose testing.[5]
</p><p>Intermittent or continuous renal replacement therapy may be used if indicated. However, sodium bicarbonate is not recommended for a person with lactic acidosis secondary to hypoperfusion. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression devices are recommended for any person with sepsis at moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism.[5] Stress ulcer prevention with proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and H2 antagonist are useful in a person with risk factors of developing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) such as on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, coagulation disorders, liver disease, and renal replacement therapy.[5] Achieving partial or full enteral feeding (delivery of nutrients through a feeding tube) is chosen as the best approach to provide nutrition for a person who is contraindicated for oral intake or unable to tolerate orally in the first seven days of sepsis when compared to intravenous nutrition. However, omega-3 fatty acids are not recommended as immune supplements for a person with sepsis or septic shock. The usage of prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin are recommended for those who are septic and unable to tolerate enteral feeding. However, these agents may precipitate prolongation of the QT interval and consequently provoke a ventricular arrhythmia such as torsades de pointes. The usage of prokinetic agents should be reassessed daily and stopped if no longer indicated.[5]

133,sickle cell anemia,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><div>Further information: Pain management in children</div><p>Treatment involves a number of measures. L-glutamine use was supported by the FDA starting at the age of 5 as it decreases complications.[49]
</p><h3>Folic acid and penicillin[edit]</h3><p>From birth to five years of age, penicillin daily, due to the immature immune system that makes them more prone to early childhood illnesses is recommended.[50] Dietary supplementation of folic acid had been previously recommended by the WHO.[5] A 2016 Cochrane review of its use found ""the effect of supplementation on anaemia and any symptoms of anaemia remains unclear"" due to a lack of medical evidence.[51]
</p><h3>Malaria prevention[edit]</h3><p>The protective effect of sickle cell trait does not apply to people with sickle cell disease; in fact, they are more vulnerable to malaria, since the most common cause of painful crises in malarial countries is infection with malaria. It has therefore been recommended that people with sickle cell disease living in malarial countries should receive lifelong medication for prevention.[52]
</p><h3>Vaso-occlusive crisis[edit]</h3><p>Most people with sickle cell disease have intensely painful episodes called vaso-occlusive crises. However, the frequency, severity, and duration of these crises vary tremendously. Painful crises are treated symptomatically with pain medications; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on NSAIDs (such as diclofenac or naproxen). For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices are commonly used in this setting. Diphenhydramine is also an effective agent that doctors frequently prescribe to help control itching associated with the use of opioids.[citation needed]
</p><h3>Acute chest crisis[edit]</h3><p>Management is similar to vaso-occlusive crisis, with the addition of antibiotics (usually a quinolone or macrolide, since cell wall-deficient [""atypical""] bacteria are thought to contribute to the syndrome),[53] oxygen supplementation for hypoxia, and close observation. Should the pulmonary infiltrate worsen or the oxygen requirements increase, simple blood transfusion or exchange transfusion is indicated. The latter involves the exchange of a significant portion of the person's red cell mass for normal red cells, which decreases the percent of haemoglobin S in the patient's blood. The patient with suspected acute chest syndrome should be admitted to the hospital with worsening A-a gradient an indication for ICU admission.[25]
</p><h3>Hydroxyurea[edit]</h3><p>The first approved drug for the causative treatment of sickle cell anaemia, hydroxyurea, was shown to decrease the number and severity of attacks in a study in 1995[54] and shown to possibly increase survival time in a study in 2003.[55] This is achieved, in part, by reactivating fetal haemoglobin production in place of the haemoglobin S that causes sickle cell anaemia. Hydroxyurea had previously been used as a chemotherapy agent, and there is some concern that long-term use may be harmful, but this risk has been shown to be either absent or very small and it is likely that the benefits outweigh the risks.[16][56]
</p><h3>Blood transfusion[edit]</h3><p>Blood transfusions are often used in the management of sickle cell disease in acute cases and to prevent complications by decreasing the number of red blood cells (RBC) that can sickle by adding normal red blood cells.[57] In children preventative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of first stroke or silent stroke when transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography shows abnormal cerebral blood flow.[6] In those who have sustained a prior stroke event it also reduces the risk of recurrent stroke and additional silent strokes.[58][59]
</p><h3>Bone marrow transplant[edit]</h3><p>Bone marrow transplants have proven effective in children. Bone marrow transplants are the only known cure for SCD.[60] However, bone marrow transplants are difficult to obtain because of the specific HLA typing necessary. Ideally, a close relative (allogeneic) would donate the bone marrow necessary for transplantation.
</p><h3>Avascular necrosis[edit]</h3><p>When treating avascular necrosis of the bone in people with sickle cell disease, the aim of treatment is to reduce or stop the pain and maintain joint mobility.[61] Current treatment options are to rest the joint, physical therapy, pain relief medicine, joint replacement surgery, or bone grafting.[61] High quality randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the most effective treatment option and determine if a combination of physical therapy and surgery are more effective than physical therapy alone.[61]
</p><h3>Psychological therapies[edit]</h3><p>Psychological therapies such as patient education, cognitive therapy, behavioural therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy, that aim to complement current medical treatments, require further research to determine their effectiveness.[21]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><h3>Umbilical cord blood transplant[edit]</h3><p>While umbilical cord blood transplant can potentially cure the condition, a suitable donor is available in only 10% of people.[113] About 7% of people also die as a result of the procedure and graft versus host disease may occur.[113]
</p><h3>Gene therapy[edit]</h3><p>In 2001, it was reported that sickle cell disease had been successfully treated in mice using gene therapy.[114][115] The researchers used a viral vector to make the mice—which have essentially the same defect that causes human sickle cell disease—express production of fetal haemoglobin (HbF), which an individual normally ceases to produce shortly after birth. In humans, using hydroxyurea to stimulate the production of HbF has been known to temporarily alleviate sickle cell disease symptoms. The researchers demonstrated that this gene therapy method is a more permanent way to increase therapeutic HbF production.[116]
</p><p>Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease in humans were started in 2014. The clinical trials will assess the safety of lentiviral vector-modified bone marrow for adults with severe sickle cell disease.[117][118] As of 2018, however, no randomized controlled trials have been reported.[119] A case report for the first person treated was published in March 2017 with a few more people being treated since then.[120][121]

135,stenosis aortic valve,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>Treatment is generally not necessary in people without symptoms.[8] In moderate cases, echocardiography is performed every 1–2 years to monitor the progression, possibly complemented with a cardiac stress test.[15] In severe cases, echocardiography is performed every 3–6 months.[15] In both moderate and mild cases, the person should immediately make a revisit or be admitted for inpatient care if any new related symptoms appear.[15] There are no therapeutic options currently available to treat people with aortic valve stenosis; however, studies have indicated that the disease occurs as a result of active cellular processes, suggesting that targeting these processes may lead to viable therapeutic approaches.[24]
</p><h3>Medication[edit]</h3><p>The effect of statins on the progression of AS is unclear. The latest trials do not show any benefit in slowing AS progression,[6] but did demonstrate a decrease in ischemic cardiovascular events.[3]
</p><p>In general, medical therapy has relatively poor efficacy in treating aortic stenosis.[8]  However, it may be useful to manage commonly coexisting conditions that correlate with aortic stenosis:
</p><ul>Any angina is generally treated with beta-blockers and/or calcium blockers.[15] Nitrates are contraindicated due to their potential to cause profound hypotension in aortic stenosis.[25]
Any hypertension is treated aggressively, but caution must be taken in administering beta-blockers.[15]
Any heart failure is generally treated with digoxin and diuretics, and, if not contraindicated, cautious administration of ACE inhibitors.[15]</ul><p>While observational studies demonstrated an association between lowered cholesterol with statins and decreased progression, a randomized clinical trial published in 2005 failed to find any effect on calcific aortic stenosis. A 2007 study did demonstrate a slowing of aortic stenosis with the statin rosuvastatin.[6][26]
</p><h3>Aortic valve repair[edit]</h3><div>Main article: aortic valve repair</div><p>Aortic valve repair or aortic valve reconstruction describes the reconstruction of both form and function of the native and dysfunctioning aortic valve. Most frequently it is applied for the treatment of aortic regurgitation. It can also become necessary for the treatment of an aortic aneurysm, less frequently for congenital aortic stenosis.[27]  
</p><h3>Aortic valve replacement[edit]</h3><div>Main article: aortic valve replacement</div><p>In adults, symptomatic severe aortic stenosis usually requires aortic valve replacement (AVR).[3] While AVR has been the standard of care for aortic stenosis for several decades, currently aortic valve replacement approaches include open heart surgery, minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) and minimally invasive catheter-based (percutaneous) aortic valve replacement.[28][29] However, surgical aortic valve replacement is well studied and generally has a good and well established longer-term prognosis.[30]
</p><p>A diseased aortic valve is most commonly replaced using a surgical procedure with either a mechanical or a tissue valve. The procedure is done either in an open-heart surgical procedure or, in a smaller but growing number of cases, a minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) procedure.
</p><h3>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement[edit]</h3><p>Globally more than 250,000 people have received transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). For people who are not candidates for surgical valve replacement and most patients who are older than 75, TAVR may be a suitable alternative.[28][29]
</p><h3>Balloon valvuloplasty[edit]</h3><p>For infants and children, balloon valvuloplasty, where a balloon is inflated to stretch the valve and allow greater flow, may also be effective. In adults, however, it is generally ineffective, as the valve tends to return to a stenosed state. The surgeon will make a small incision at the top of the person's leg and proceed to insert the balloon into the artery. The balloon is then advanced up to the valve and is inflated to stretch the valve open.[31]
</p><h3>Heart failure[edit]</h3><p>Acute decompensated heart failure due to AS may be temporarily managed by an intra-aortic balloon pump while pending surgery.[32] In those with high blood pressure nitroprusside may be carefully used.[1] Phenylephrine may be used in those with very low blood pressure.[2]
</p><h2>Research[edit]</h2><p>People on bisphosphonates have less progression of aortic stenosis and some regressed.[36][37] This finding led to multiple trials which are ongoing. Subsequent research has failed to confirm the initial positive result.[38]

136,suicide attempt,"Treatment

Treatment of suicidal thoughts and behavior depends on your specific situation, including your level of suicide risk and what underlying problems may be causing your suicidal thoughts or behavior.
Nonemergency situations

If you have suicidal thoughts, but aren't in a crisis situation, you may need outpatient treatment. This treatment may include:

    Psychotherapy. In psychotherapy, also called psychological counseling or talk therapy, you explore the issues that make you feel suicidal and learn skills to help manage emotions more effectively. You and your therapist can work together to develop a treatment plan and goals.
    Medications. Antidepressants, antipsychotic medications, anti-anxiety medications and other medications for mental illness can help reduce symptoms, which can help you feel less suicidal.
    Addiction treatment. Treatment for drug or alcohol addiction can include detoxification, addiction treatment programs and self-help group meetings.
    Family support and education. Your loved ones can be both a source of support and conflict. Involving them in treatment can help them understand what you're going through, give them better coping skills, and improve family communication and relationships.

139,thrombocytopaenia,"<h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>Treatment is guided by the severity and specific cause of the disease. Treatment focuses on eliminating the underlying problem, whether that means discontinuing drugs suspected to cause it or treating underlying sepsis.  Diagnosis and treatment of serious thrombocytopenia is usually directed by a hematologist. Corticosteroids may be used to increase platelet production. Lithium carbonate or folate may also be used to stimulate platelet production in the bone marrow.[20]
</p><h3>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura[edit]</h3><p>Treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a medical emergency, since the associated hemolytic anemia and platelet activation can lead to renal failure and changes in the level of consciousness.  Treatment of TTP was revolutionized in the 1980s with the application of plasmapheresis.  According to the Furlan-Tsai hypothesis,[21] this treatment works by removing antibodies against the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS-13.  The plasmapheresis procedure also adds active ADAMTS-13 protease proteins to the patient, restoring a normal level of von Willebrand factor multimers.  Patients with persistent antibodies against ADAMTS-13 do not always manifest TTP, and these antibodies alone are not sufficient to explain how plasmapheresis treats TTP.[22]
</p><h3>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura[edit]</h3><div> Oral petechiae/purpura - Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</div><p>Many cases of ITP can be left untreated, and spontaneous remission (especially in children) is not uncommon. However, counts of under 50,000 are usually monitored with regular blood tests, and those with counts of under 10,000 are usually treated, as the risk of serious spontaneous bleeding is high with such a low platelet count. Any patient experiencing severe bleeding symptoms is also usually treated. The threshold for treating ITP has decreased since the 1990s; hematologists recognize that patients rarely spontaneously bleed with platelet counts greater than 10,000, although there are documented exceptions to this observation.[23][24]
</p><p>Thrombopoetin analogues have been tested extensively for the treatment of ITP.  These agents had previously shown promise but had been found to stimulate antibodies against endogenous thrombopoietin or lead to thrombosis. Romiplostim (trade name Nplate, formerly AMG 531) was found to be safe and effective for the treatment of ITP in refractory patients, especially those who relapsed following splenectomy.[25]
</p><h3>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia[edit]</h3><div>Main article: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</div><p>Discontinuation of heparin is critical in a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Beyond that, however, clinicians generally treat to avoid thrombosis.[26] Treatment may include a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as lepirudin or argatroban. Other blood thinners sometimes used in this setting include bivalirudin and fondaparinux.  Platelet transfusions are not routinely used to treat HIT because thrombosis, not bleeding, is the primary problem.[27] Warfarin is not recommended until platelets have normalized.[27]
</p><h3>Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia[edit]</h3><p>Bone marrow/stem cell transplants are the only known cures for this genetic disease. Frequent platelet transfusions are required to keep the patient from bleeding to death before the transplant can be performed, although this is not always the case.[28]

140,thrombus,"<h2>Prevention and treatment[edit]</h2><div>Main articles: Thrombolysis, Thrombosis prophylaxis, and Reperfusion therapy</div><table>This section needs more medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources. Please review the contents of the section and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2018)</table><p>Blood clot prevention and treatment reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack and pulmonary embolism. Heparin and warfarin are used to inhibit the formation and growth of existing thrombi, with the former used for acute anticoagulation while the latter is used for long-term anticoagulation.[2] The mechanism of action of heparin and warfarin are different as they work on different pathways of the coagulation cascade.[5] Heparin works by binding to and activating the enzyme inhibitor antithrombin III, an enzyme that acts by inactivating thrombin and factor Xa.[5] In contrast, warfarin works by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme needed to synthesize vitamin K dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X.[5][6] Bleeding time with heparin and warfarin therapy can be measured with the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and prothrombin time (PT), respectively.[6]
</p><p>Some treatments have been derived from bacteria.  One drug is streptokinase, which is an enzyme secreted by several streptococcal bacteria.[7]  This drug is administered intravenously and can be used to dissolve blood clots in coronary vessels.  However, streptokinase is nonspecific and can digest almost any protein, which can lead to many secondary problems.  Another clot-dissolving enzyme that works faster and is more specific is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).[7] This drug is made by transgenic bacteria and it converts plasminogen into the clot-dissolving enzyme, plasmin.[8]  There are also some anticoagulants that come from animals that work by dissolving fibrin. For example, Haementeria ghilianii, an Amazon leech, produces an enzyme called hementin from its salivary glands.[9] As of 2012[update], this enzyme has been successfully produced by genetically engineered bacteria and is administered to cardiac patients.
</p><p>More recent research indicates that tPA could have toxic effects in the central nervous system. In cases of severe stroke, tPA can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter interstitial fluid, where it then increases excitotoxicity, potentially affecting permeability of the blood-brain barrier,[10] and may even cause cerebral hemorrhaging.[11]

141,tonic-clonic epilepsy,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><p>For a person experiencing a tonic–clonic seizure, first-aid treatment includes rolling the person over into the recovery position, which can prevent asphyxiation by preventing fluid from entering the lungs.[12] Other general actions to take as recommended by the Epilepsy Foundation include: staying with a person until a seizure is over, paying attention to length of seizure as a possible indication for status epilepticus and/or indication to give rescue medication and call for emergency help, moving close objects out of the way to prevent injury. It is also not recommended to hold a person down that is having a seizure as that can lead to injury, as well as not putting anything in a person's mouth as these items can become choking hazards.[13] Long-term therapy may include the use of antiepileptic drugs, surgical therapy,  diet therapy, vagus nerve stimulation, or radio surgery.[3]

</p>"
143,transient ischemic attack,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Although there is a lack of robust studies demonstrating the efficacy of lifestyle changes in preventing TIA, many medical professionals recommend them.[17] These include:
</p><ul>Avoiding smoking
Cutting down on fats to help reduce the amount of plaque build up
Eating a healthy diet including plenty of fruits and vegetables
Limiting sodium in the diet, thereby reducing blood pressure
Exercising regularly
Moderating intake of alcohol, stimulants, sympathomimetics, etc.
Maintaining a healthy weight</ul><p>In addition, it is important to control any underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of stroke or TIA, including:[17]
</p><ul>Hypertension
High cholesterol
Diabetes mellitus
Atrial fibrillation</ul><h2>Treatment[edit]</h2><p>By definition, TIAs are transient, self-resolving, and do not cause permanent impairment. However, they are associated with an increased risk of subsequent ischemic strokes, which can be permanently disabling.[18] Therefore, management centers around the prevention of future ischemic strokes and addressing any modifiable risk factors. The optimal regimen depends on the underlying cause of the TIA.
</p><h3>Lifestyle modification[edit]</h3><p>Lifestyle changes have not been shown to reduce the risk of stroke after TIA.[19] While no studies have looked at the optimal diet for secondary prevention of stroke, some observational studies have shown that a mediterranean diet can reduce stroke risk in patients without cerebrovascular disease.[20] A mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and limited in red meats and sweets. Vitamin supplementation has not been found to be useful in secondary stroke prevention.[20]
</p><h3>Antiplatelet medications[edit]</h3><p>The antiplatelet medications, aspirin and clopidogrel, are both recommended for secondary prevention of stroke after high risk TIAs.[20][21] The clopidogrel can generally be stopped after 10 to 21 days.[21] An exception is TIAs due to blood clots originating from the heart, in which case anticoagulants are generally recommended.[20] After TIA or minor stroke, aspirin therapy has been shown to reduce the short-term risk of recurrent stroke by 60-70%, and the long-term risk of stroke by 13%.[22]
</p><p>The typical therapy may include aspirin alone, a combination of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole, or clopidogrel alone.[20] Clopidogrel and aspirin have similar efficacies and side effect profiles. Clopidogrel is more expensive and has a slightly decreased risk of GI bleed.[20] Another antiplatelet, ticlopidine, is rarely used due to increased side effects.[20]
</p><h3>Anticoagulant medications[edit]</h3><p>Anticoagulants may be started if the TIA is thought to be attributable to atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm that may cause the formation of blood clots that can travel to the brain, resulting in TIAs or ischemic strokes. Atrial fibrillation increases stroke risk by five times, and is thought to cause 10-12% of all ischemic strokes in the US.[20][23] Anticoagulant therapy can decrease the relative risk of ischemic stroke in those with atrial fibrillation by 67%[24] Warfarin is a common anticoagulant used, but direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, have been shown to be equally effective while also conferring a lower risk of bleeding.[23][25] Generally, anticoagulants and antiplatelets are not used in combination, as they result in increased bleeding risk without a decrease in stroke risk.[20] However, combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy may be warranted if the patient has symptomatic coronary artery disease in addition to atrial fibrillation.
</p><p>Sometimes, myocardial infarction (“heart attack”) may lead to the formation of a blood clot in one of the chambers of the heart. If this is thought to be the cause of the TIA, people may be temporarily treated with warfarin or other anticoagulant to decrease the risk of future stroke.[20]
</p><h3>Blood pressure control[edit]</h3><p>Blood pressure control may be indicated after TIA to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. About 70% of patients with recent ischemic stroke are found to have hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mmHg.[20] Until the first half of the 2010s, blood pressure goals have generally been SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg.[20] However, newer studies suggest that a goal of SBP <130 mmHg may confer even greater benefit.[26][27]  Blood pressure control is often achieved using diuretics or a combination of diuretics and angiotensin converter enzyme inhibitors, although the optimal treatment regimen depends on the individual.[20]
</p><h3>Cholesterol control[edit]</h3><p>There is inconsistent evidence regarding the effect of LDL-cholesterol levels on stroke risk after TIA. Elevated cholesterol may increase ischemic stroke risk while decreasing the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.[28][29][30] While its role in stroke prevention is currently unclear, statin therapy has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality and may be recommended after TIA.[20]
</p><h3>Diabetes control[edit]</h3><p>Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of ischemic stroke by 1.5-3.7 times, and may account for at least 8% of first ischemic strokes.[20] While intensive glucose control can prevent certain complications of diabetes such as kidney damage and retinal damage, there has previously been little evidence that it decreases the risk of stroke or death.[31] However, data from 2017 suggests that metformin, pioglitazone and semaglutide may reduce stroke risk.[31]
</p><h3>Surgery[edit]</h3><p>If the TIA affects an area that is supplied by the carotid arteries, a carotid ultrasound scan may demonstrate stenosis, or narrowing, of the carotid artery.  For people with extra-cranial carotid stenosis, if 70-99% of the carotid artery is clogged, carotid endarterectomy can decrease the 5-year risk of ischemic stroke by approximately half.[32] For those with extra-cranial stenosis between 50-69%, carotid endarterectomy decreases the 5-year risk of ischemic stroke by about 16%.[32] For those with extra-cranial stenosis less than 50%, carotid endarterectomy does not reduce stroke risk and may, in some cases, increase it.[32] The efficacy of carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting in reducing stroke risk in patients with intra-cranial carotid artery stenosis is currently unknown.[20]
</p><p>In carotid endarterectomy, a surgeon makes an incision in the neck, opens up the carotid artery, and removes the plaque occluding the blood vessel. The artery may then be repaired by adding a graft from another vessel in the body, or a woven patch. In patients who undergo carotid endarterectomy after a TIA or minor stroke, the 30 day risk of death or stroke is 7%.[32]
</p><p>Carotid artery stenting is a less invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy for patients with extra-cranial carotid artery stenosis. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a small cut in the groin and threads a small flexible tube, called a catheter, into the patient’s carotid artery. A balloon is inflated at the site of stenosis, opening up the clogged artery to allow for increased blood flow to the brain. To keep the vessel open, a small wire mesh coil, called a stent, may be inflated along with the balloon. The stent remains in place, and the balloon is removed.
</p><p>In patients over age 70, carotid endarterectomy is associated with fewer postoperative deaths or strokes than carotid artery stenting.[33] In younger patients, there is no significant difference in outcomes between carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting.[33]  People who undergo carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting for stroke prevention are medically managed with antiplatelets, statins, and other interventions as well.[20]

144,tricuspid valve insufficiency,"<h2>Management[edit]</h2><div> ACE inhibitor</div><p>In terms of treatment for tricuspid insufficiency prosthetic valve substitutes can be used, though artificial prostheses may cause thrombo‐embolic phenomena (bioprostheses may have a degeneration problem).[9] Some evidence suggests that there are no significant differences between a mechanical or biological tricuspid valve in a recipient.[10] Surgery for tricuspid insufficiency vs. no surgery has been statistically assessed by looking back on consecutive series of hospital cases, mainly of secondary tricuspid insufficiency.  In these cases, one finds that surgery predicts outliving non-surgery cases initially matched in health ~60% of the time (HR = .74)[11]
</p><p>Generally, surgical treatment of tricuspid regurgitation is not indicated when it has arisen as a result of right ventricular dilatation. In such instances of secondary tricuspid regurgitation, the mainstay of therapy is medical. When left-sided heart failure is the cause, the individual is instructed to decrease intake of salt. Medications in this case may include diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.[12]
</p>"
145,ulcer peptic,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Prevention of peptic ulcer disease for those who are taking NSAIDs (with low cardiovascular risk) can be achieved by adding proton pump inhibitor (PPI), H2 antagonist, or misoprostol.[14] NSAIDs of the COX-2 inhibitors type may reduce the rate of ulcers when compared to non-selective NSAIDs.[14] PPI is the most popular agent in peptic ulcer prevention.[14] However, there is no evidence that H2 antagonist can prevent stomach bleeding for those taking NSAIDs.[14] Although misoprostol is effective in preventing peptic ulcer, its properties of promoting abortion and causing gastrointestinal distress limits its use.[14] For those with high cardiovascular risk, naproxen with PPI can be a useful choice.[14] Otherwise, low dose aspirin, celecoxib, and PPI can also be used.[14]
</p><h2>Management[edit]</h2><div> Peptic ulcer treatment: pharmacology of drugs</div><h3>Eradication therapy[edit]</h3><p>Once the diagnosis of H. pylori is confirmed, the first line treatment would be a triple regimen where pantoprazole and clarithromycin can be combined with either amoxicillin or metronidazole. This treatment regimen can be given for 7 until 14 days. However, its effectiveness of eradicating H. pylori has been reducing from 90% to 70%. However, the rate of eradication can be increased by doubling the dosage of pantoprazole or increase the duration of treatment to 14 days. Quadruple therapy (pantoprazole + clarithromycin + amoxicillin + metronidazole) can also be used. The quadruple therapy can achieve an eradication rate of 90%. If the clarithromycin resistance rate is higher than 15% in an area, the usage of clarithromycin should be abandoned. Instead bismuth containing quadruple therapy can be used (pantoprazole + bismuth citrate + tetracycline + metronidazole) for 14 days. The bismuth therapy can also achieve an eradication rate of 90% and can be used as second line therapy when the first line triple regimen therapy failed.[14]
</p><p>After H. pylori is eradicated, there is low risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding when NSAIDs are resumed.[14]
</p><h3>NSAIDs induced ulcers[edit]</h3><p>NSAIDs associated ulcers heal in 6 to 8 weeks provided the NSAIDs are withdrawn with the introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPI).[14]
</p><h3>Bleeding[edit]</h3><p>For those with bleeding peptic ulcers, fluid replacement with crystalloids should be given to maintain volume in the blood vessels. Hameoglobin should be maintained at greater than 70 g/dL through restrictive blood transfusion because it has been associated with reduced rate of death. Glasgow-Blatchford score is useful in determining whether a patient should be treated inside hospital or as outpatient. Intravenous PPI can give faster stomach bleeding suppression compared to oral ones. A neutral stomach pH is required to keep platelet in place and to prevent clot lysis. Tranexamic acid and antifibrinolytic agents are not useful in peptic ulcer disease.[14]
</p><p>Early endoscopic therapy can help to stop bleeding by using cautery, endoclip or epinephrine injection. Treatment is indicated if there is active bleeding in the stomach, visible vessel, or an adherent clot. Endoscopy is also helpful in identifying patients suitable for hospital discharge. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin and metoclopramide can be given before endoscopy to improve endoscopic view. Either high or low dose PPI are equally effective in reducing bleeding after endoscopy. High dose intravenous PPI is defined as bolus dose of 80 mg followed by infusion of 8 mg per hour for 72 hours. In other words, it is the continuous infusion of PPI of greater than 192 mg per day. Intravenous PPI can be changed to oral once there is no high risk of rebleeding from peptic ulcer.[14]
</p><p>For those with hypovolemic shock and ulcer size of greater than 2 cm, there is a high chance that the endoscopic treatment would fail. Therefore, surgery and angiographic embolism are reserved for these complicated cases. However, there is a higher rate of complication for those who underwent surgery to patch the stomach bleeding site when compared to repeated endoscopy. Angiographic embolisation has higher rebleeding rate but has similar rate of death when compared to surgery.[14]
</p><h3>Anticoagulants[edit]</h3><p>According to expert opinion, those who are already on anticoagulants, international normalized ratio (INR) should be kept at 1.5. For aspirin users who required endoscopic treatment for bleeding peptic ulcer, there is two times increased risk of rebleeding but with 10 times reduced risk of death at 8 weeks post resumption of aspirin. For those who were on double antiplatelet agents for indwelling stent in blood vessels, both antiplatelet agents should not be stopped because there is high risk of stent thrombosis. For those which was under warfarin treatment, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant factor VIIa can be given to reverse the effect of warfarin. High dose of vitamin K should be avoided to reduce the time for rewarfarinisation once the stomach bleeding has stopped. Prothrombin complex concentrates is preferred for severe bleeding. Recombinant factor VIIa is reserved for life-threatening bleeding because of its high risk of thromboembolism.[14] Direct oral anticoagulants  (DOAC) is recommended instead of warfarin as they are more effective in preventing thromboembolism. In case of bleeding caused by DOAC, activated charcoal within 4 hours is the antidote of choice. Hamodialysis maybe given for bleeding caused by dabigatran. Anticoagulants should be resumed as soon as possible for those with high cardiovascular risk because although risk of rebleeding increases, the overall mortality decreases with resumption of anticoagulants.[14]

146,upper respiratory infection,"<h2>Prevention[edit]</h2><p>Low- or very-low quality evidence indicates probiotics may be better than placebo in preventing acute URTIs.[10] Vaccination against influenza viruses, adenoviruses, measles, rubella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, diphtheria, Bacillus anthracis, and Bordetella pertussis may prevent them from infecting the URT or reduce the severity of the infection.[citation needed]

</p><h3>Antibiotics[edit]</h3><p>Prescribing antibiotics for laryngitis is not a suggested practice.[14] The antibiotics penicillin V and erythromycin are not effective for treating acute laryngitis.[14] Erythromycin may improve voice disturbances after a week and cough after 2 weeks, but any modest subjective benefit is not greater than the adverse effects, cost, and the risk of bacteria developing resistance to the antibiotics.[14]  Health authorities have been strongly encouraging physicians to decrease the prescribing of antibiotics to treat common URTIs because antibiotic usage does not significantly reduce recovery time for these viral illnesses.[14] The use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics has been shown to be just as effective as broad-spectrum alternatives for children with acute bacterial URTIs, and has a lower risk of side effects in children[15]. Decreased antibiotic usage could also have prevented drug-resistant bacteria.[citation needed] Some have advocated a delayed antibiotic approach to treating URTIs, which seeks to reduce the consumption of antibiotics while attempting to maintain patient satisfaction. A Cochrane review (updated 2017) of 11 studies and 3,555 participants explored antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. It compared delaying antibiotic treatment to either starting them immediately or to no antibiotics. Outcomes were mixed depending on the respiratory tract infection; symptoms of acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved with immediate antibiotics with minimal difference in complication rate. Antibiotic usage was reduced when antibiotics were only used for ongoing symptoms and maintained patient satisfaction at 86%.[16]

Therefore, decongestants are not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age with the common cold.[18]  Oral decongestants are also contraindicated in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and history of bleeding strokes.[19][20]
</p><h3>Over-the-counter cough medicine[edit]</h3><p>No good evidence supports the effectiveness of over-the-counter cough medications for reducing coughing in adults or children.[21] Children under 2 years old should not be given any type of cough or cold medicine due to the potential for life-threatening side effects.[22] In addition, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the use of cough medicine to relieve cough symptoms should be avoided in children under 4 years old, and the safety is questioned for children under 6 years old.[23]
</p><h3>Alternative medicine[edit]</h3><p>Routine supplementation with vitamin C is not justified, as it does not appear to be effective in reducing the incidence of common colds in the general population.[24] The use of vitamin C in the inhibition and treatment of upper respiratory infections has been suggested since the initial isolation of vitamin C in the 1930s. Some evidence exists to indicate that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and/or cold environments.[24] Given that vitamin C supplements are inexpensive and safe, people with common colds may consider trying vitamin C supplements to assess whether they are therapeutically beneficial in their case.[24]
</p><p>Some low-quality evidence indicates the use of nasal irrigation with saline solution may alleviate symptoms in some people.[25] Also, saline nasal sprays can be of benefit.[citation needed]
